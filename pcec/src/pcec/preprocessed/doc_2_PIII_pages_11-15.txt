year only to be reported? If an employee has a deferral which has a tranche of a prior
year paid out after they have left the Branch, is it expected that this would be reported
or not? If a prior year tranches awarded is reported should this be reported if the
individual is no longer an employee of the Branch?
All contract earnings of all employees need to be reported even if the employee is earning
compensation in UAE and outside UAE. The full contractual award needs to be mentioned
and not only the physical payout
Question 9: Is the End of Service Benefit (EOSB) i.e. severance payment for a normal
leaver to be reported depending upon the definition of “other material risk taker” OR
are banks also required to report any additional payment such as a redundancy type
payment? Should a transfer of Senior Management personnel or Other Material Risk-
takers to other branch of the Bank be considered as severance for reporting purpose?
All payments regardless of the type of payment based on the contract needs to be reported
Question 10: For branches of foreign banks where the Head Office reports to the home
regulator, there are pre-fixed formats prepared and submitted at a frequency as
stipulated by home regulator. Can the branch of foreign banks provide such reports
in UAE which are submitted to the home regulator as a part of UAE Pillar 3
Disclosures?
Reports sent between Head Office and UAE needs to be separated and only the Pillar 3
disclosures as per this Guidance needs to be reported for UAE branches in the mandatory
formats published here.
Question 11: What does “Fully loaded” ECL accounting model mean and what is the
difference between total capital and fully loaded capital?
"Fully Loaded" means bank’s regulatory capital compared with a situation where the
transitional arrangement had not been applied
Question 12: For branches of foreign banks, would Central Bank allow for a transition
period if the threshold for partial disclosure is reached? (i.e. if RWA exceed AED 5
billion)
Transition will be granted on a case by case basis
Question 13: Currently CCyB buffer is 0% in UAE. In this case, what do banks need to
report in CCyB template?
Currently CCyB is not applicable in UAE but if banks in UAE have branches in other countries
this needs to be reported if CCyB is being reported as per that foreign country’s regulations.
Banks, hence, need to calculate and fill the CCyB1 as explained in the Capital Supply
standards.
Question 14: In Sheet CR5, for "Unrated" Category, should we include the Post CRM
and CCF amounts in their respective Risk Weight categories or should we club it
under "Others"?
Yes, it can be placed in “Others” along with any other ratings.
Question 15: In Sheet OV1, is the minimum requirements simply 10.5% of the RWA.
Pillar 1 capital requirements at the reporting date will normally be RWA*10.5% but may differ
if a floor is applicable or adjustments (such as scaling factors).
Question 16: CCR8 requires Bank to report Exposures to Non QCCPs (excluding initial
margin and default fund contribution) arising of (i) OTC derivatives, (ii) Exchange-
traded derivatives, (iii) Securities financing transactions & (iv) Netting sets where
cross-product netting has been approved. Does this mean the Exposures computed
under SA-CCR which are eligible under Netting Jurisdiction to be disclosed under
(iv)?
Currently, UAE has no netting jurisdiction but such exposures reported will be taken into

Question 17: LIQA, Liquidity exposures and funding needs at the level of individual
legal entities, foreign branches and subsidiaries, taking into account legal, regulatory
and operational limitations on the transferability of capital. Are insurance or non-bank
subsidiaries to be included?
All entities that are consolidated by the bank must be included.
Question 18: LIQA, Balance sheet and off-balance sheet items broken down into
maturity buckets and the resultant liquidity gaps. Is there any format for reporting the

Leverage Ratio
I. Introduction
Risk-based capital adequacy ratios measure the extent to which a bank has sufficient
capital relative to the risk of its business activities. They are based on a foundational
principle: that a bank that takes higher risks should have higher capital to compensate.
Leverage, on the other hand, measures the extent to which a bank has financed its
assets with equity. It does not matter what those assets are, or their risk characteristics. The
leverage ratio, by placing an absolute cap on exposures relative to a bank’s capital, is an
important component of the Central Bank capital framework, and complements the risk-
based capital adequacy regime. However, neither of these parts of the framework stands
alone: it is important to look at Central Bank capital requirements as a package of constraints
that mutually reinforce prudent behaviour. Even though the leverage ratio has been designed
as a backstop, it must be a meaningful backstop if it is to serve its intended purpose.
One of the underlying causes of the global financial crisis is believed to have been
the build-up of excessive on- and off-balance-sheet leverage in the banking system. At the
height of the crisis, developments in financial markets forced banks to reduce leverage in a
manner that likely amplified downward pressures on asset prices. This deleveraging process
exacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital, and shrinking credit
availability.
The Central Bank’s leverage ratio framework introduces a simple, transparent, non-
risk-based leverage ratio to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based
capital requirements. The leverage ratiois intended to:
 restrict the build-up of leverage in the banking sector to avoid destabilizing
deleveraging processes that can damage the broader financial system and the
economy; and
 reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk-based “backstop”
measure.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) adopted the leverage ratio
with the launch of Basel III in December 2010. A revised leverage ratio framework, titled
Basel III Leverage Ratio Framework and Disclosure Requirements, was published in January
2014. In December 2017, the leverage ratio was finalized along with the rest of the Basel III
capital framework. Prior to each release of the leverage ratio, the BCBS published
consultative documentation and sought comments from the industry. Additionally, in 2015
and 2017, the BCBS published revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements, including updated
disclosure requirements for the leverage ratio.
In designing the UAE leverage ratio framework, the Central Bank considered the full
evolution of the BCBS leverage ratio, including consultative frameworks, reporting
requirements, and comments raised by banks and industry bodies across the globe. The
Central Bank’s Standards for Leverage Ratio is based closely on the requirements
articulated by the BCBS in the document Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms, December
2017.
This Guidance should be read in conjunction with the Central Bank’s Standards on
Leverage Ratio, as it is intended to provide clarification of the requirements of that Standards,
and together with that Standards supports the Central Bank’s Regulations Re Capital
Adequacy.

II. Clarifications of the Standards
The leverage ratio framework is designed to capture leverage associated with both
on- and off-balance-sheet exposures. It also aims to make use of accounting measures to
the greatest extent possible, while at the same time addressing concerns that (i) different
accounting frameworks across jurisdictions raise level playing field issues and (ii) a
framework based exclusively on accounting measures may not capture all risks.
a. Leverage Ratio and Capital
The leverage ratio is defined as the capital measure divided by the exposure
measure, expressed as a percentage:
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒
𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =
𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒
The capital measure is Tier 1 capital as defined for the purposes of the Central Bank
risk-based capital framework, subject to transitional arrangements. In other words, the capital
measure for the leverage ratio at a particular point in time is the applicable Tier 1 capital
measure at that time under the risk-based framework.
The minimum requirement for the leverage ratio is established in the Central Bank’s
Regulations Re Capital Adequacy.
The Standards includes the possibility that the Central Bank may consider
temporarily exempting certain central bank “reserves” from the leverage ratio exposure
measure to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies in exceptional macroeconomic
circumstances. In this context, the term “reserves” refers to certain bank balances or
placements at the Central Bank. Certain other jurisdictions have pursued monetary policies
that resulted in a significant expansion of such bank balances at the Central Bank, for
example through policies commonly described as “quantitative easing.” While the Central
Bank has no plan to implement such policies, the inclusion of this flexibility in the Standards
ensures that, in the event that such policies were to be implemented, the minimum leverage
requirement could be adjusted in a manner that allows it to continue to serve its appropriate
prudential role. Per the requirements of the BCBS framework, the Central Bank would also
increase the calibration of the minimum leverage ratio requirement commensurately to offset
the impact of exempting central bank reserves, since actual bank leverage ratios would be
expected to increase due to the exclusion of these exposures.
b. Scope of Consolidation
The framework applies on a consolidated basis, following the same scope of
regulatory consolidation used in the risk-based capital requirements (see Regulations re
Capital Adequacy). For example, if proportional consolidation is applied for regulatory
consolidation under the risk-based framework, the same criteria shall be applied for leverage
ratio purposes.
Where a banking, financial, insurance or commercial entity is outside the scope of
regulatory consolidation, only the investment in the capital of such entities (that is, only the
carrying value of the investment, as opposed to the underlying assets and other exposures
of the investee) is included in the exposure measure. However, any such investments that
are deducted from Tier 1 capital may be excluded from the exposure measure.
195

c. Exposure Measure
The exposure measure includes both on-balance-sheet exposures and off-balance-
sheet (OBS) items. On-balance-sheet exposures are generally included at their accounting
value, although exposures arising from derivatives transactions and securities financing
transactions (SFTs) are subject to separate treatment.
Except where a different treatment is specified, no offset is allowed for physical or
financial collateral held, guarantees in favour of the bank or other credit risk mitigation
techniques.
Balance sheet assets that are deducted from Tier 1 capital may also be deducted
from the exposure measure. For example:
 Where a banking, financial or insurance entity is not included in the regulatory scope
of consolidation, the amount of any investment in the capital of that entity that is totally
or partially deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) or Additional Tier 1 capital
may also be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure.
 Prudent valuation adjustments for exposures to less liquid positions that are deducted
from Tier 1 capital as per the Central Bank’s Market Risk Standards may be deducted
from the leverage ratio exposure measure.
Liability items must not be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure. For
example, gains/losses on fair valued liabilities or accounting value adjustments on derivative
liabilities due to changes in the bank’s own credit risk must not be deducted from the leverage
ratio exposure measure.
The Central Bank will be vigilant to transactions and structures that have the result
of inadequately capturing banks’ sources of leverage. Examples of concerns that might arise
in such leverage ratio exposure measure minimizing transactions and structures may
include: securities financing transactions where exposure to the counterparty increases as
the counterparty’s credit quality decreases or securities financing transactions in which the
credit quality of the counterparty is positively correlated with the value of the securities
received in the transaction (i.e. the credit quality of the counterparty falls when the value of
the securities falls); banks that normally act as principal but adopt an agency model to
transact in derivatives and SFTs in order to benefit from the more favorable treatment
permitted for agency transactions under the leverage ratio framework; collateral swap trades
structured to mitigate inclusion in the leverage ratio exposure measure; or use of structures
to move assets off the balance sheet. This list of examples is by no means exhaustive.
d. On-Balance Sheet Exposures
Where a bank recognizes fiduciary assets on the balance sheet, these assets can be
excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure provided that the assets meet the IFRS
9 criteria for de-recognition and, where applicable, IFRS 10 for deconsolidation.
e. Derivative Exposures
The basis for the framework’s treatment of derivative transactions is a modified
version of Standardised Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) in Basel III. It
captures both the exposure arising from the underlying of the derivative contract and the
related counterparty credit risk. The exposure measure amount is generally equal to the sum
of the replacement cost (the mark-to-market value of contracts with positive value) and an
add-on representing the transaction’s potential future exposure, with that sum multiplied by
a scaling factor of 1.4. Valid bilateral netting contracts can reduce the exposure amount, but
196

collateral received generally cannot. There are specific rules governing the treatment of cash
variation margin, clearing services and written credit derivatives.
If, under a bank’s operative accounting standards, there is no accounting measure of
exposure for certain derivative instruments because they are held (completely) off balance
sheet, the bank must use the sum of positive fair values of these derivatives as the
replacement cost.
Netting across product categories such as derivatives and SFTs is not permitted in
determining the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, where a bank has a cross-
product netting agreement in place that meets the eligibility criteria; it may choose to perform
netting separately in each product category provided that all other conditions for netting in
