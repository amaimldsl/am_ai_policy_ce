two are different, the higher of the two risk weights should be applied.
Question 10: If a counterparty is within a legal organizational structure that includes
multiple entities with different ratings, which rating should be used for the CVA capital
calculation?
The bank should use the rating for the entity that is actually obligated as a counterparty to the
bank under the terms of the transactions within the applicable netting set.
Question 11: Is there any special CVA treatment for counterparties that have a zero risk
weight for credit risk under the risk-based capital standards?
No, they are treated like all other counterparties (other than CCPs). Note that CVA risk is different
from the more general type of credit risk treated under the risk-based standards. The risk weights
in the CVA standards are intended to reflect credit spread risk, and generally differ from the risk
weights used for other capital requirements. Forall counterparties, apply the CVA risk weight that
corresponds to the rating of the entity, or if unrated, apply the approach specified for unrated
counterparties.
Question 12: We prefer to map unrated counterparties to CCC asa conservative treatment;
is that acceptable, or must they be mapped to BBB?
The bank is free to apply a more conservative treatment to unrated counterparties, and should do
so if it considers the more conservative treatment to be appropriate. However, the bank should
be consistent in its approach, and should not apply this process in a way that might reduce
exposure for the CVA calculation relative to the treatment stated in the standards.
Question 13: Should all SFT exposures be considered in scope for the CVA calculation, or
only those that create gross SFT assets per the leverage ratio exposure measure? Will SFT
exposures be classified separately for the computation of Credit RWAs in CAR
computation?
All SFTs should be reflected in the CVA calculation, whether or not they create non-zero gross
SFT asset values for the leverage ratio.
Credit risk capital for SFT exposures is addressed as part of the general credit risk standards for
risk-based capital adequacy requirements.
Question 14: When determining exposure for SFTs, are haircuts to be applied to the fair
value of the securities?
No, haircuts should not be applied – use the fair value without haircuts.
Question 15: Can the weighted average maturity for SFT exposures be based on the
exposure amounts?
Yes, that approach is acceptable, provided it is applied consistently.
Question 16: Can we consider Global Master Repo Agreements signed with banks in the
UAE as qualifying master netting agreements (MNA) for SFT exposure computation?
Banks should apply the requirements for valid netting agreements as stated in the Central Bank’s
Standards for Counterparty Credit Risk to determine whether netting is valid in any particular
case, rather than using broad categorical criteria.

Question 17: Will the Central Bank establish a specific quantitative materiality threshold
to determine whether SFTs are in scope for CVA capital?
The Central Bank does not intend to establish a specific threshold, but instead will determine the
materiality of CVA risk from SFTs on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant factors
that may affect the CVA risk posed by SFTs at each bank.
Question 18: The CVA guidelines require computation of single-name exposure (SNE),
while the CCR Standards is based on hedging sets; different names may be included in
the same hedging set. Does this create an inconsistency?
It does not. Note that the single “name” for CVA capital is the derivatives or SFT counterparty. It
does not depend on any underlying reference names for credit derivatives or other transactions
with a given counterparty. Suppose for example that a bank has two credit derivatives that depend
on the performance of Company A and Company B (that is, those are the underlying reference
names for the credit derivatives), and that the bank’s counterparty for both credit derivatives is
another bank, Bank C. Under the CCR standards, assuming that the netting requirements are
met, the two credit derivatives would be in a single hedging set within a netting set with Bank C.
For calculation of CVA capital, the SNE would reflect the bank’s CCR exposure to the single
“name” that is Bank C; neither the names nor the ratings of Company A or Company B enter the
CVA calculation directly. The CVA risk-weight for the bank’s CVA capital calculation would depend
on the credit rating of Bank C, not the ratings of either Company A or Company B.
Question 19: Should we multiply the sum of replacement cost and potential future
exposure by the same 1.4 scaling factor used in the SA-CCR standards issued by Central
Bank?
Yes, that is correct; the same multiplicative scaling factor of 1.4 should be used for the CVA
calculation as well.
Question 20: Can banks used the Basic Approach for CVA (BA-CVA) recently published by
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2017?
Not at this time. The Central Bank may consider the BA-CVA at a later date.
Question 21: Bank ask in case of calculating discounted counterparty exposure is a double
count and will inflate CVA Capital charge given SA-CCR EAD already factors in maturity
adjustment while computing adjusted notional which is product of trade notional &
supervisory duration?
The use of the discount factor in the CVA capital charge does not result in double counting. While
there is superficial similarity between the supervisory duration (SD) adjustment in SA-CCR and
the discount factor (DF) in CVA, they are actually capturing different aspects of risk exposure.
The use of SD in SA-CCR adjusts the notional amount of the derivatives to reflect its sensitivity
to changes in interest rates, since longer-term derivatives are more sensitive to rate changes than
are shorter-term derivatives. In contrast, the use of DF in the CVA calculation reflects the fact that
a bank is exposed to CVA risk not only during the first year of a derivative contract, but over the
life of the contract; the DF term recognizes the present value of the exposure over the life of the
contract. Thus, these two factors, although they have similar functional forms and therefore
appear somewhat similar, are not in fact duplicative.
Question 22: Further elaboration on "equivalent hedging instrument that directly
references the counterparty being hedged"?
This could be any instrument or contract that refers specifically to the counterparty by name, and
whose value increases when the credit quality of the counterparty being hedged deteriorates.
However, it does not include "nth-to-default" credit derivatives.
Question 23: What if a Bank hold a CVA liability in our books, charged to P&L, once we
78

CBUAE Classification: Public
have the additional capital requirement on CVA, will this liability be netted off against the
CVA capital requirement, or an add back to the capital for this P&L charge will be
incorporated?
Incurred CVA losses should be used toreduce EAD.
IV. Examples
A. CVA capital and RWA with no hedging
For this example, a bank has only two derivatives counterparties, Galaxy Financial with a AA
credit rating, and Solar Systems with a BB credit rating. The bank computes counterparty credit
risk (CCR) exposure as 800 for Galaxy, and 200 for Solar, following the requirements of the CCR
Standards. The bank uses the standardised approach rather than the simple alternative to
compute CVA capital and RWA.
The bank calculates the weighted average maturity for exposures to Galaxy at 3 years, and for
Solar 1 year. In this example, the bank has no eligible hedges for CVA risk for either counterparty.
Example: Derivatives Portfolio for the Bank
# Counterparty Name Credit Rating CCR Exposure Maturity
1 Galaxy Financial AA 800 3 years
2 Solar Systems BB 200 1 year
The bank must compute the supervisory discount factor, DF, for each of the two counterparties.

Using the formula in the Standards, the calculations are:
(1−𝑒−.05×3)
𝐷𝐹 = =2.786
1 .05
(1−𝑒−.05×1)
𝐷𝐹 = =0.975
2 .05
Using these supervisory discount factors, the bank calculates single-name exposure for each
counterparty, taking into account the fact that there are no eligible CVA hedges:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 =𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 =800×2.786=2229
1 1 1
𝑆𝑁𝐸 =𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 =200×0.975=195
2 2 2
The bank must also determine the appropriate risk weights for each of these single-name
exposures. Because Galaxy is rated AA, the appropriate risk weight is 0.7% from Table 1 of the
Standards. Solar is rated BB, so the corresponding risk weight is 2.0%. That is, W =0.007, and
1
W 2=0.02.
The bank’s calculation of CVA capital must use the formula in the Standards:

𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖

Substituting in the relevant values for Galaxy and Solar, the calculation is:

=2.33√95.06+182.52+11.41=2.33√288.99=39.61
In the final step, the bank must compute RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as
required in the Standards:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 39.61 × 12.5 = 495.16
B. CVA capital and RWA with a single-name hedge
The bank from the previous example has the same portfolio, but in this example enters into a
CDS with a third party that provides protection on Galaxy Financial, to protect against a potential
increase in credit spreads that would reduce the fair value of transactions with Galaxy if Galaxy’s
credit quality deteriorates. The notional value of the CDS is 400, with a maturity of 2 years. Thus,
the calculation must now take into account the impact of an eligible single-name CVA hedge, with
H
1
= 400 and M
h
= 2.
The bank must compute the supervisory discount factor for the CVA hedge:
(1−𝑒−.05×2)
𝐷𝐹 = =1.903
𝐻 .05
The presence of the CVA hedge for Galaxy changes. Galaxy’s SNE calculation:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 =(𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 )−(𝐻 ×𝐷𝐹 )
1 1 1 1 𝐻
=(800×2.786)−(400×1.903)=2228.7−761.3≈1467
The remainder of the computations proceed as before, with the new value for SNE 1:
𝐾 =2.33√(0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 +0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2

=2.33√(5.13+1.95)2+0.75×(10.27)2+0.75×(3.90)2
=2.33√50.13+79.10+11.41=2.33√140.64=27.63
In the final step, the bank computes RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as
required in the Standards:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 27.63 × 12.5 = 345.38
This example illustrates the impact of CVA risk mitigation, as the presence of the eligible CVA
hedge reduces CVA capital and RWA compared to the previous example with no hedging.

C. CVA capital and RWA with an index hedge
The bank from the previous example has the same portfolio, including the single-name hedge of
Galaxy Financial, but now enters into an index CDS that provides credit spread protection against
a basket of twenty named entities. The notional value of the index CDS is 300, with a maturity of
1.5 years. The bank’s calculation of CVA capital now takes into account the impact of an eligible
index hedge, which reduces systematic CVA risk. The relevant form of the calculation from the
Standard is:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸 −∑𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 ) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
Because the bank has only one index hedge, the summation for index hedges inside the
calculation has only a single (Wind Hind DFind) term. As stated above, the notional value of the
hedge is Hind=300. The bank needs to calculate the appropriate supervisory discount factor for
the index CDS, based on the maturity Mind=1.5 years:
(1−𝑒−.05×1.5)
𝐷𝐹 = =1.445
𝑖𝑛𝑑 .05
To determine the risk weight, the bank must determine the credit rating for each of the twenty
reference names in the index basket, the corresponding risk weight for each rating (from Table 1
in the Standard), and the weighted average of those risk weights using the relative notional values
of the component names for the weights. Suppose that through this process of analysis, the bank
determines that the weighted average is 1.2% (slightly worse than BBB). As a result, Wind=0.012.
The impact of risk mitigation from the index CDS enters the calculation through the term:
𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 =0.012×300×1.445=5.20
𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑
The bank can now calculate CVA capital, taking into account the impact of the index hedge that
mitigates systematic risk. Many of the relevant values are unchanged from the previous example,
but there is the addition of the index hedge effect on systematic CVA risk:
𝐾 =2.33√(0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 +0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 −𝑾 𝑯 𝑫𝑭 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2

As before, the bank computes RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as required in
the Standard:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 22.59 × 12.5 = 282.38
