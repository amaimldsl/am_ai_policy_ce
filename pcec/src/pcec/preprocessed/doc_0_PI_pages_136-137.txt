VII. Appendix
Further Options under the ASA – Option 1
Under the ASA Option 1, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking using a common
beta of 15%, instead of 12% and 15%, respectively, as prescribed under the Standardised
Approach (SA). For the other six business lines, the relevant beta factors as prescribed under the
SA are used. The exposure indicator remains the volume of loans and advances for commercial
and retail banking and gross income for the other six business lines.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 2
Under Option 2, banks may maintain the SA beta factors of 12% and 15% for retail and
commercial banking and aggregate the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The
volume of loans and advances is used as the exposure indicator for commercial and retail
banking. Gross income is used for the other six business lines. Banks undertaking predominantly
traditional banking activities, such as retail and commercial banking, and unable to segregate
their grossincome according to businesslines may find it useful to adopt this option.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 3
Under Option 3, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking with a beta factor of 15%
and the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The volume of loans and advances is
used as the exposure indicator for retail banking and commercial banking. Gross income is used
for the other six business lines.

X. External Credit Assessment Institutions
I. Introduction and Scope
1. Banks are required to use external ratings to determine risk weights for certain types of
exposures. However, only external ratings provided by External Credit Assessment Institutions
(ECAIs) that have been recognized as eligible for that purpose by the Central Bank may be used.
This Guidance describes the specific requirements for the recognition of eligible ECAIs, together
with certain other aspects of the use of ratings within the Central Bank’s capital adequacy
framework. Note that additional requirements related to the use of ratings in capital requirements
for securitisation are provided in the Central Bank’s Standards on Required Capital for
Securitisation Exposures.
2. The Guidance is based closely on requirements of the framework for capital adequacy
developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), specifically the requirements
articulated by the BCBS in International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards: A Revised Framework (comprehensive version June 2006), and the revisions from
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, December
2010 (rev June 2011).
II. Eligibility Criteria
3. ECAIs may beconsidered eligible for recognition if they meet the criteria articulated in this
section. The Central Bank also takes into account the criteria and conditions provided in the
IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies (IOSCO CRA Code) when
determining ECAI eligibility.
4. The Central Bank’s eligibility determination for each ECAI applies only with respect to the
types of claims for which the eligibility criteria have been met by that ECAI.
A. Objectivity
5. ECAI’s should have a methodology for assigning credit ratings that is rigorous and
systematic, and is subject to validation based on historical experience. Ratings assessments
should be based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. Moreover,
assessments must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition.
To establish that an ECAI fulfils this primary component of eligibility criteria, it must demonstrate
that it meets the following minimum standards:
(i) The ECAI has established rating definitions, criteria, and methodologies, and apply
them consistently;
(ii) The ECAI should have a robust procedure of rating assignment based on published
information, market data, interviews with management, and/or other sources of
information that provide a sound basis for purposes of assigning the ratings;
(iii) When assigning risk ratings, the ECAI should take into account all major features of
credit quality that are relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology, and should
ensure that the ratings are assigned taking into account all risk factors of the rated
entity or issue relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology;

(iv) The ECAI should demonstrate that rating methodologies are subject to quantitative
back testing. For this purpose, the ECAI should calculate and publish default studies,
recovery studies, rating transition matrices, or other analyses as relevant to the
ECAI’s rating methodology. The analysis should reflect a definition of default that is
