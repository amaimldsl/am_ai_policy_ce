C. CVA capital and RWA with an index hedge
The bank from the previous example has the same portfolio, including the single-name hedge of
Galaxy Financial, but now enters into an index CDS that provides credit spread protection against
a basket of twenty named entities. The notional value of the index CDS is 300, with a maturity of
1.5 years. The bank’s calculation of CVA capital now takes into account the impact of an eligible
index hedge, which reduces systematic CVA risk. The relevant form of the calculation from the
Standard is:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸 −∑𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 ) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
Because the bank has only one index hedge, the summation for index hedges inside the
calculation has only a single (Wind Hind DFind) term. As stated above, the notional value of the
hedge is Hind=300. The bank needs to calculate the appropriate supervisory discount factor for
the index CDS, based on the maturity Mind=1.5 years:
(1−𝑒−.05×1.5)
𝐷𝐹 = =1.445
𝑖𝑛𝑑 .05
To determine the risk weight, the bank must determine the credit rating for each of the twenty
reference names in the index basket, the corresponding risk weight for each rating (from Table 1
in the Standard), and the weighted average of those risk weights using the relative notional values
of the component names for the weights. Suppose that through this process of analysis, the bank
determines that the weighted average is 1.2% (slightly worse than BBB). As a result, Wind=0.012.
The impact of risk mitigation from the index CDS enters the calculation through the term:
𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 =0.012×300×1.445=5.20
𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑
The bank can now calculate CVA capital, taking into account the impact of the index hedge that
mitigates systematic risk. Many of the relevant values are unchanged from the previous example,
but there is the addition of the index hedge effect on systematic CVA risk:
𝐾 =2.33√(0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 +0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 −𝑾 𝑯 𝑫𝑭 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2
1 1 2 2 𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒏𝒅 1 1 2 2
=2.33√(0.5×0.007×1467+0.5×0.02×195−𝟎.𝟎𝟏𝟐×𝟑𝟎𝟎×𝟏.𝟒𝟒𝟓)2+0.75×(0.007×1467)2+0.75×(0.02×195)2
=2.33√(5.13+1.95−𝟓.𝟐𝟎)2+0.75×(10.27)2+0.75×(3.90)2
=2.33√3.53+79.10+11.41=2.33√94.04=22.59
As before, the bank computes RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as required in
the Standard:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 22.59 × 12.5 = 282.38

VI. Equity Investments in Funds
I. Introduction
In December 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a
revised framework for calculating the capital requirements for banks’ equity investments in funds
held in the banking book. This followed a BCBS review of the risk-based capital requirements for
banks’ exposures to funds, undertaken as part of the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking. The BCBS review was undertaken
to clarify the existing treatment of such exposures in the Basel II capital adequacy framework and
to achieve a more internationally consistent and risk-sensitive capital treatment for banks’
investments in the equity of funds, reflecting both the risk of the fund’s underlying investments
and its leverage.
Following the approach developed by the BCBS in Capital requirements for banks’ equity
investments in funds, (BCBS 266, published December 2013), the Central Bank Standards for
minimum required capital for banks’ equity investments in funds relies on a hierarchy of three
successive approaches to risk weighting of fund assets, with varying degrees of risk sensitivity
and conservatism:
 The “look-through approach” (LTA): The LTA is the most granular approach. Subject to
meeting the conditions set out for its use, banks employing the LTA must apply the risk
weight of the fund’s underlying exposures as if the exposures were held directly by the
bank;
 The “mandate-based approach” (MBA): The MBA provides a degree of risk sensitivity,
and can be used when banks do not meet the conditions for applying the LTA. Banks
employing the MBA assign risk weights on the basis of the information contained in a
fund’s mandate or in relevant regulations, national legislation, or other similar rules under
which the fund is required to operate; and
 The “fall-back approach” (FBA): When neither of the above approaches is feasible, the
FBA must be used. The FBA applies a 1250 percent risk weight to a bank’s equity
investment in the fund.
To ensure that banks have appropriate incentives to enhance the risk management of their
exposures, the degree of conservatism increases with each successive approach.
The capital framework for banks’ equity investments in funds also incorporates a leverage
adjustment to the risk-weighted assets derived from the above approaches to appropriately reflect
a fund’s leverage.

II. Clarifications
A. Scope
The Standards covers banks’ equity investments held in the banking book. Note that equity
positions within the trading book are covered by the market risk capital requirements that apply
to trading book positions.
The Central Bank has chosen not to use the national discretion provided within the BCBS
framework to exclude from the standard equity positions in entities whose debt obligations qualify
for a zero risk weight. The Central Bank also has chosen not to use the national discretion
provided within the BCBS framework to exclude from the scope of the standard equity investments
made under identified official programs that support specified sectors of the economy
B. General Design of the Capital Requirement
At a high level, the framework is designed such that the risk-weight for a bank’s equity
investment in a fund depends on the average risk weight that would be applicable to the assets
of the fund, and on the extent of use of leverage by the fund. The approach to the average risk
weight for any fund will reflect one or more of the three approaches described briefly above (and
described more fully in the Standards).
The illustration below gives a general overview of how the average risk weight and
leverage are combined, subject to a cap of 1250%, and then applied to the bank’s equity
investment in the funds.
For example, if the average risk weight of the assets held by the fund is 80%, and the fund
is financed through half debt and half equity, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 2.0 and
the risk weight applied to a bank’s investment in the fund would be:
80% x 2.0 = 160%
If instead the same fund is financed 90% by debt, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 10,
and the risk weight applied to the bank’s investment in the fund would be 800% (80% x 10).
Another way to view the capital requirement for equity investments in funds is that a bank
generally must count a proportional amount of the risk-weighted assets (RWA) of the fund as the
bank’s own RWA for capital purposes, in proportion to the bank’s share of the equity of the fund.
Ignoring the 1250% limit for simplicity, the RWA calculation can bewritten as:
𝑅𝑊𝐴 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑅𝑊𝐴 =( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘′𝑠 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑

𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑
=𝑅𝑊𝐴 ×𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘′𝑠 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑
The rearrangement of the terms in the equation highlights that the bank’s RWA from the EIF is
the bank’s proportional share of the fund’s RWA – if the bank holds a 5% share of the equity in
the fund, then the bank’s RWA is 5% of the total RWA of the fund. This isa logical treatment – if
a bank effectively owns 5% of a fund, the bank must hold capital as if it owns 5% of the fund’s
risk-weighted assets.
C. Look-Through Approach
The LTA requires a bank to assign the same risk weights to the underlying exposures of
a fund as would be assigned if the bank held the exposures directly. The information used for to
determine the risk weights must meet the requirements stated in the Standards, including
sufficiency, frequency, and third party review. However, that information is not required to be
derived from sources that are subject to an external audit.
RWA and assets of investment funds should, to the extent possible, be evaluated using
the same accounting standards the bank would apply if the assets were held directly. However,
where this is not possible due to constraints on available information, the evaluation can be based
on the accounting standards applied by the investment fund, provided the treatment of the
numerator (RWA) and the denominator (total unweighted assets) is consistent.
If a bank relies on third-party calculations for determining the underlying risk weights of
