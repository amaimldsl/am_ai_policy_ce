Consider a netting set with three commodity forward contracts. All notional amounts and market
values are denominated in USD. This netting set is not subject to a margin agreement and there
is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below
summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three commodity derivatives.

1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives’ market values at the reference date, provided that value is positive. Thus,
using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {100 - 30 - 50; 0} = 20
The replacement cost is positive and there is no exchange of collateral (so the bank has not
received excess collateral), which means the multiplier will be equal to 1.

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward & swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Since the remaining maturity of Trade 1 is less than a year, at nine months (approximately 187
business days), and the trade is un-margined, its maturity factor is scaled down by the square
root of 187/250 in accordance with the requirements of the Standards. On the other hand, the
maturity factor is 1 for Trade 2 and for Trade 3, since the remaining maturity of those two trades
is greater than one year and they are un-margined.
The trade-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory delta
times the maturity factor. The basic difference between the WTI and Brent forward contracts
effectively is ignored since they belong to the same commodity type, namely “Crude Oil” within
the “Energy” hedging set, thus allowing for full offsetting. (In contrast, if one of the two forward
contracts were on a different commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set, such as natural
gas, with the other on crude oil, then only partial offsetting would have been allowed between the
two trades.) Therefore, Trade 1 and Trade 2 can be aggregated into a single effective notional,
taking into account each trade’s supervisory delta and maturity factor.

both the Crude Oil commodity type in the Energy hedging set and the Silver commodity type in
the Metals hedging set is SF=18%.
Thus, the add-on by hedging set and commodity type is as follows:

Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The commodity-type add-ons in a hedging set are decomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic
components. The commodity subclass correlations parameters are as stated in the Standards, in
this case 40% for commodities.
Thus, the hedging set level add-ons are calculated for each commodity hedging set:
Add-on(COM) = [( Σ

However, in this example, since only one commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set is
populated (i.e. all other commodity types within that hedging set have a zero add-on), the resulting
add-on for the hedging set is the same as the add-on for the commodity type. This calculation
shows that when there is only one commodity type within a commodity hedging set, the hedging-
set add-on is equal to the absolute value of the commodity-type add-on. (The same comment
applies to the commodity type “Silver” in the “Metals” hedging set.)
Add-on Aggregation
Aggregation of commodity-type add-ons uses full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component in each hedging set. As noted earlier, in this
example there is only one commodity type per hedging set, which means no offsetting benefits.
Computing the simple summation of absolute values of add-ons for the hedging sets:
Add-on = Σ Add-on

Add-On = 2,043 + 1,800 = 3,843

VI. Illustrations of Replacement Cost Calculations with Margining

margined definitions below) is greater than the resulting RC
 TH = positive threshold before the counterparty must send collateral to the bank
 MTA = minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty
 NICA = net independent collateral amount other than variation margin (unsegregated or
segregated) posted to the bank, minus the unsegregated collateral posted by the bank.
The quantity TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest net exposure, including all
collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral
call.
A. Illustration 1: Margined Transaction
A bank has AED80 million in trades with a counterparty. The bank currently has met all past
variation margin (VM) calls, so the value of trades with the counterparty is offset by cumulative
VM in the form of cash collateral received. Furthermore, an “Independent Amount” (IA) of AED 10
million was agreed in favour of the bank, and none in favour of its counterparty. This leads to a
64

[Document: document.pdf, Page 67]
CBUAE Classification: Public
credit support amount of AED 90 million (80 million plus 10 million), which is assumed to have
been fully received as of the reporting date. There is a small “Minimum Transfer Amount” (MTA)
of AED1 million, and a “Threshold” (TH) of zero.
In this example, the V-C term in the replacement cost (RC) formula is zero, since the value of the
trades is more than offset by collateral received; AED80 million – AED90 million = -10 million. The
term (TH + MTA - NICA) is -9 million (0 TH + 1 million MTA - 10 million of NICA held). Using the
replacing cost formula:
RC = MAX {(V-C), (TH+MTA-NICA), 0}
= MAX{(80-90),(0+1-10),0}
= MAX{-10,-9,0} = 0
Because both V-C and TH+MTA-NICA are negative, the replacement cost is zero. This occurs
because of the large amount of collateral posted by the bank’s counterparty.
B. Illustration 2: Initial Margin
A bank, in its capacity as clearing member of a CCP, has posted VM to the CCP in an amount
equal to the value of the trades it has with the CCP. The bank has posted AED10 million in cash
as initial margin, and the initial margin is held in such a manner as to be bankruptcy-remote from
the CCP. Assume that the value of trades with the CCP are -50 million, and the bank has posted
AED50 million in VM to the CCP. Also assume that MTA and TH are both zero under the terms
of clearing at the CCP.
In this case, the V-C term is zero, since the already posted VM offsets the negative value of V.
The TH+MTA-NICA term is also zero, since MTA and TH both equal zero, and the initial margin
held by the CCP is bankruptcy remote and thus does not affect NICA. Thus:
RC = MAX {(V-C), (TH+MTA-NICA), 0}
= MAX{(-50-(-50)), (0+0-0), 0}
= MAX{0,0,0} = 0
Therefore, the replacement cost RC is zero.
C. Illustration 3: Initial Margin Not Bankruptcy Remote
Consider the same case as in Illustration 2, except that the initial margin posted to the CCP is not
bankruptcy remote. Since this now counts as part of the collateral C, the value of V-C is AED10
million. The value of the TH+MTA-NICA term is AED10 million due to the negative NICA of -10
million. In this case:
RC = MAX {(V-C), (TH+MTA-NICA), 0}
= MAX{(-50-(-50)-(-10)), (0+0-(-10)), 0}
= MAX{10,10,0} = 10
65

[Document: document.pdf, Page 68]
CBUAE Classification: Public
The RC is now AED10 million, representing the initial margin posted to the CCP that would be
lost if the CCP were to default.
D. Illustration 4: Maintenance Margin Agreement
Some margin agreements specify that a counterparty must maintain a level of collateral that is a
fixed percentage of the mark-to-market (MtM) of the transactions in the netting set. For this type
of margining agreement, the Independent Collateral Amount (ICA) is the percentage of MtM that
the counterparty must maintain above the net MtM of the transactions covered by the margin
agreement. For example, suppose the agreement states that a counterparty must maintain a
collateral balance of at least 140% of the MtM of its transactions. Further suppose for purposes
of this illustration that there is no TH and no MTA, and that the MTM of the derivative transactions
is 50. The counterparty posts 80 in cash collateral. ICA in this case is the amount that the
counterparty is required to post above the MTM (140%x50 – 50 = 20). Since MtM minus the
collateral is negative (50-80 = -30), and MTA+TH-NICA also is negative (0+0-20 = -20), the
replacement cost RC is zero. In terms of the replacement cost formula:
RC = MAX {(V-C), (TH+MTA-NICA), 0}
= MAX{(50-80), (0+0-20), 0}
= MAX{-30,-20,0} = 0

V. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
I. Introduction
A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is an adjustment to the fair value of a derivative
instrument to account for counterparty credit risk. CVA is commonly viewed as the cost of
counterparty credit risk. For any given position with a counterparty, this cost depends on the
market’s perception of the riskiness of the counterparty, as reflected for example in counterparty
credit spreads, as well as on the market value of the exposure, which typically depends on
underlying market factors.
During the financial crisis, banks suffered significant losses due to counterparty risk
exposure on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Various analyses have concluded that the
majority of these losses came not from counterparty defaults but from fair value adjustments on
derivatives. The value of outstanding derivative assets was written down as it became apparent
that counterparties had become less likely to meet their obligations. These types of credit-related
losses, reflected in changes in CVA, are now widely recognized as a source of risk for banks
involved in derivatives activity.
Under the Basel II market risk framework, firms were required to hold capital against the
variability in the market value of their derivatives in the trading book, but there was no requirement
to capitalize against variability in CVA. Counterparty credit risk capital under Basel II was based
on the credit risk framework, and designed to provide protection against default and migration risk
rather than the potential losses that can arise through variations in CVA.
To address this gap in the prudential capital framework, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) introduced the CVA capital charge as part of Basel III in December 2010.
The purpose of the Basel III CVA capital charge is to ensure that bank capital provides adequate
protection against the risks of future changes in CVA.
In line with the requirements of Basel III, UAE banks are required to calculate risk-weighted
assets (RWA) for CVA risk under one of two approaches. Banks must use either:
 A standardised approach, described in the Standards and closely based on the
standardised approach to CVA risk capital developed by the BCBS; or
 A simple alternative approach, under which a bank with an aggregate notional
amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives less than or equal to 400 billion AED
may calculate RWA for CVA by setting it equal to the bank’s counterparty credit
risk (CCR) RWA.
The Central Bank is fully aware of the BCBS view that CVA risk cannot be modelled by
banks in a robust and prudent manner at this time. Accordingly, the Central Bank has determined
that CVA approaches that rely on banks’ internal CVA models, or that use inputs derived from
those models, are not appropriate for use in regulatory capital calculations by UAE banks.

II. Clarifications
A. Scope
The CVA standards covers all of a bank’s non-centrally cleared derivative exposures. In
the context of the CVA standards, derivatives are instruments whose value is based upon the
price or value associated with an underlying reference entity. In general, derivatives exhibit the
following abstract characteristics:
 The transactions generate a current exposure or market value.
 The transactions have an associated random future market value based on market
variables.
 The transactions have contractual terms that provide for an exchange of payments
or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment.
 The transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty.
Other common characteristics of derivative transactions may include the following:
 Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure, and may be inherent in the nature
of some transactions.
 Netting may be used to mitigate risk or to simplify operational aspects of the
transaction.
 Positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), with the value
dependent on market variables or their changes.
 Margin payments may be employed, with margin held in various forms, and with
re-margining agreements that allow for the adjustment of margin either daily or at
some other established frequency.
In addition, the Central Bank has used national discretion to include securities financing
transactions (SFTs) – transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase
agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions – within the scope
of the CVA calculation. However, as the Standards note, if the Central Bank determines that SFT
exposures at any individual bank are not a material source of CVA risk, the Central Bank may
direct the bank to exclude SFTs from CVA capital calculations.
Consistent with the BCBS framework, all derivative transactions for which a central
counterparty is the direct counterparty are excluded from the CVA capital calculation. Banks must
calculate RWA for those centrally cleared transactions as specified in the Central Bank’s CCR
Standards.
B. CVA Overview
The Central Bank’s approach to minimum required capital for CVA risk is based closely on the
standardised approach to CVA risk capital described in Basel III: A global regulatory framework
for more resilient banks and banking systems (BCBS 189, December 2010, rev June 2011). A
few elements also draw on clarifications and other information provided in BCBS publications
responding to Frequently Asked Questions, or clarifications contained in Basel III: Finalising
post-crisis reforms published by the BCBS in December 2017.
68

[Document: document.pdf, Page 71]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Regulatory CVA may differ from the CVA calculated under IFRS or other accounting
standards. In particular, regulatory CVA excludes any consideration of the effect of changes in a
bank’s own credit risk as perceived by the market. This means that regulatory CVA calculations
do not consider so-called debit valuation adjustments, or DVA.
C. Hedging
The calculation allows banks to recognize the risk mitigating benefits of certain eligible
CVA hedges. The Standards allows only certain types of instruments to serve as eligible hedges
for CVA, specifically an index credit default swap (CDS), or a single-name CDS, single-name
contingent CDS, or equivalent hedging instrument that directly references the counterparty being
hedged. An option on an eligible CDS (that is, a swaption on such a CDS) can be eligible, provided
the swaption does not contain a “knock out” clause that terminates the swaption in the case of a
credit event. Eligible hedges that are included in the CVA capital charge are removed from the
bank’s market risk capital calculation.
Other types of instruments must not be reflected as hedges within the calculation of the
CVA capital charge, even if the bank views them as mitigating counterparty credit risk. For
example, tranched or nth-to-default CDS instruments are not eligible CVA hedges. These instead
must be treated as any other similar instrument in the bank’s portfolio for regulatory capital
purposes.
In addition to the restrictions regarding the types of instruments that a bank may recognize
as CVA hedges, only transactions entered into explicitly for the purpose of hedging the
counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk can be eligible hedges. This means, for
example, that a bank might have a single-name CDS referencing an OTC counterparty in its
portfolio, and yet that CDS would not be eligible to offset the single-name CVA exposure within
the CVA calculation if that CDS was not originated or acquired as part of the bank’s process to
manage CVA risk for that particular counterparty.
To clearly demonstrate intent to manage CVA risk, the bank should have a documented
CVA risk management process or program, so that any CVA hedging transaction is demonstrably
consistent with the design and operation of that program, was entered into with the intent to
mitigate the counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk, and continues to be managed by
the bank in a manner consistent with that intent. The Central Bank expects that any bank wishing
to recognize the benefits of hedges in CVA capital calculations will maintain policies and
procedures to govern this process. If the Central Bank concludes that a bank’s CVA hedging
policies and procedures are inadequate, the Central Bank may limit the bank’s ability to recognize
hedges in CVA capital calculations.
Another key principle for CVA hedging is that risk mitigation should transfer risk to third
parties external to the bank. Some banks use internal transactions to transfer risk between
different desks or business units within the bank as part of a broader risk management program,
with these transactions typically subject to some type of internal transfer pricing mechanism. Such
transactions are permissible and can be a valid component of the management of CVA risk within
a bank, but the risk ultimately should be transferred out of the bank, which generally requires a
corresponding external transaction to reduce CVA risk.

D. CVA Capital Concept
The standardised approach for calculation of CVA capital is a form of a value-at-risk
calculation, an approach commonly used to set capital requirements. Changes in CVA can be
viewed as following some distribution, such as the normal distribution illustrated in Figure 2.
Conceptually, the general approach to CVA capital is to estimate a level of CVA losses that should
be expected to be exceeded no more than a given percentage of the time. The CVA capital
calculation reflects a value-at-risk calculation with a one-year, 99% confidence level for CVA risk.
Assuming a normal distribution (or equivalently, a log-normal distribution for the underlying risk
factors), losses can be expected to be within 2.33 standard deviations of the mean 99% of the
time. That concept is illustrated in Figure 2, where the 1% negative tail of the distribution has been
highlighted (in this case,  is the standard deviation).
Figure 2
Accordingly, the general form of the CVA capital calculation depends on the standard
deviation of CVA losses:
CVA capital = 2.33 × 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
= 2.33 × √𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
The normality assumption, together with a desired 99% confidence level, is the reason for the
inclusion of a 2.33 multiplication factor in the CVA capital formula. Other elements of the CVA
capital calculation reflect a theoretical approximation of the variance of changes in CVA.
E. CVA Capital Formula
In the BCBS publication of Basel III, banks using the standardised approach to calculate
CVA capital are to use the following formula:
The Central Bank’s CVA calculation, while based directly on the BCBS formula and
producing the same result, uses different (generally simpler) notation. The nature of, and
motivation for, the main notational differences are explained in this section.
70

[Document: document.pdf, Page 73]
CBUAE Classification: Public
A minor difference in notation is the omission of the multiplicative term “√ℎ” from the BCBS
formulation. This term was included by the BCBS to allow the CVA capital calculation to be
adjusted to an appropriate prudential horizon. However, in the ultimate calibration of the CVA
calculation the horizon h was established at one year, and hence h=1. Since the square root of 1
is also 1, and the term is a multiplicative factor, it has no impact on the resulting capital. Some
other jurisdictions have recognized this fact, and have omitted the √ℎ from the CVA calculation
for simplicity in their published capital regulations. The Central Bank has followed this approach.
Another difference between the BCBS notation and the presentation of the formula in the
Standards is the concept of “single-name exposure” or SNE. Under the Standards, a bank
calculates SNE for each counterparty as:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ×𝐷𝐹 − 𝐻 ×𝐷𝐹
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝐻
In this calculation, 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the bank’s total exposure to counterparty “i” across all derivatives
netting sets plus the co𝑖 unterparty exposure measure arising from SFTs with that counterparty,
and H is the total notional of eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. (The symbol
i
H is used in place of B in the BCBS formula, an appropriate adjustment of notation since it reflects
hedge instruments. DF is a supervisory discount factor, described further below.) In effect, the
discounted value of the individual counterparty exposure is offset by the discounted value of
eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. The Central Bank regards SNE as a useful
concept, because it reflects single-name exposure net of hedges. Its use also simplifies
presentation of the CVA capital formulas.
The form of the supervisory discount factor DF in the Standards differs somewhat from
the corresponding BCBS notation. Specifically, DF is defined in the CVA Standards as:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
𝐷𝐹 =
0.05
This form of DF is in effect the continuous-time present value of an M-period annuity of one AED
discounted at a rate of 5%.
71

[Document: document.pdf, Page 74]
CBUAE Classification: Public
In contrast, the BCBS formula includes the maturity term M directly in the denominator of
the supervisory discount factor, as follows:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
0.05×𝑀
However, the BCBS formula for CVA capital also multiplies by M as part of the CVA capital
calculation. As a result of that multiplication, the M in the denominator of the discount factor is
cancelled out, making the overall result the same as that provided by DF in the Standards. The
formulation in the BCBS text was designed to accommodate the fact that banks using internal
models incorporate discounting into the calculation of counterparty exposure, and those banks
are required to set the BCBS supervisory discount factor to one, while retaining the multiplication
by M. However, since internal-model approaches are not used for regulatory capital purposes in
the UAE, this flexibility is not needed, and the simpler version of the calculation has been specified
in the Standards. If for operational or other reasons a bank finds using the Basel formulation of
the discount factor more convenient, its use is acceptable, provided the bank also multiplies the
resulting discount factor by M.
If the bank uses single-name hedging only, the bank aggregates SNE across
counterparties to calculate CVA capital using the following formula:
2
𝐾 = 2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
where K is CVA capital, and Wi is the risk weight applicable to counterparty “i” taken from the
risk- weight table in the Standards.
An important insight is that CVA risk has both a systematic component and an idiosyncratic
component. The systematic component reflects the fact that credit risks of different counterparties
tend to be at least somewhat correlated with one another and move in concert, due to a degree
of dependence on the same general economic or market factors. This kind of common risk
potentially can be hedged, but cannot be reduced through diversification across counterparties.
The non-systematic, or idiosyncratic, component of CVA risk arises from factors that affect credit
spreads but are specific to an individual counterparty. In contrast to the systematic risk, the
idiosyncratic part of CVA risk can be reduced through diversification, as well as through hedging.
If a CVA portfolio is diversified to include many counterparties, it is not very likely that they would
all suffer idiosyncratic credit deterioration at the same time, so overall risk is reduced; gains on
some may offset losses on others.
The CVA capital calculation recognizes the difference between these two kinds of risk,
and treats them differently in the calculation. The first term in the square root in the capital
calculation reflects the systematic component of CVA variance:
2
(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
The exposures are weighted and summed before squaring. Holding risk weights constant,
spreading a given amount of exposure across more counterparties has no effect on this sum;
although there will be more individual terms in the summation, the sum will be the same, and thus
72

[Document: document.pdf, Page 75]
CBUAE Classification: Public
there are no gains from diversification. The second term in the square root reflects the
idiosyncratic CVA risk:
∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
Here, because the weighted exposures are squared before summing, spreading a given amount
of exposure across more counterparties reduces the total, reflecting the beneficial, risk-reducing
effects of diversifying the idiosyncratic component of counterparty credit risk.
An alternative arrangement of the CVA capital calculation may provide additional intuition:
