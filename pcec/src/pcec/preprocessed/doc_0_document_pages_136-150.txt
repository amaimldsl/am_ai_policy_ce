VI. Examples
A. Basic Indicator Approach
The Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) is a simple approach for calculating the capital charge for
operational risk. It can be used by banks that are not internationally active, as well as by banks
that are internationally active but may not as yet have risk management systems in place for using
the more advanced approaches for measuring operational risk. Below is an example of ABC bank
and how the Operational risk capital charge is calculated on Basic Indicator Approach
1- Calculating gross income through the table shows part of the income statement of
ABC bank for 2003.
Income statement of ABC bank for 2003
Operating income
Interest income 150
Interest expenses 110
Provisions made 20
Net interest income after provisions 20
Fees and commissions received 80
Fees and commissions paid 50
including fees paid for outsourcing 12
Other income
From disposal of subsidiaries 10
From disposal of available for sale 8
Investments 0
Net non-interest income 48
Total operating income 68
The net interest income to be used in gross income for calculating the operational risk capital
charge after provisions. Normally banks reduce this amount to arrive at the operating income,
however, in the calculation of capital charge for operational risk, net interest income is gross of
provisions.
In this example, net interest income is interest income minus interest expenses.
150 – 110 = 40
While for calculating net non-interest income for calculating operational risk capital charge, in this
example:
Net non-interest income is fees and commissions received (80) minus fees and commissions
paid, adjusted for outsourcing fees paid (50 – 12 = 38). Therefore, the amount will be 42.
2- Calculating operational risk capital charge under BIA
The following table shows how to calculate the operational risk capital charge under the BIA.

Income
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement under 19.5 ((390*15%)/3 or 130*15%

3- Treatment of Negative Gross Income
Below is the calculation of the operational risk capital charge when the bank has negative gross
income for a year.
Amount
Gross income year 1 -120
Gross income year 2 20
Gross income year 3 250
Total of positive gross income 270
Number of years with positive gross income 2
Average of positive annual gross income for 135 (270/2)
the last three years
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement 20.25 (135*15%)
Since negative gross income leads to exclusion of data points for that year from both the
numerator and the denominator of the BIA operational risk formula, it could at times result in some
distortions. For example, a bank that has negative gross income for one of three years might end
up with a higher operational risk capital charge than if it were to have positive gross income for
that year, even if it was a small amount. To ensure that such distortions do not occur, the
supervisor should review and consider appropriate actions under Pillar 2.
B. Standardised Approach
1- Below is small example indicated which to include and exclude in the gross income:
Included Excluded
Provisions Profits/losses from sale of securities
Operating expenses Extraordinary/ irregular items
Gross income for each business line should:
- Be gross of any provisions (for example, for unpaid interest).
- Be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers.
- Exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the banking book.
- Exclude extraordinary or irregular items as well as income derived from insurance claims.

VII. Appendix
Further Options under the ASA – Option 1
Under the ASA Option 1, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking using a common
beta of 15%, instead of 12% and 15%, respectively, as prescribed under the Standardised
Approach (SA). For the other six business lines, the relevant beta factors as prescribed under the
SA are used. The exposure indicator remains the volume of loans and advances for commercial
and retail banking and gross income for the other six business lines.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 2
Under Option 2, banks may maintain the SA beta factors of 12% and 15% for retail and
commercial banking and aggregate the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The
volume of loans and advances is used as the exposure indicator for commercial and retail
banking. Gross income is used for the other six business lines. Banks undertaking predominantly
traditional banking activities, such as retail and commercial banking, and unable to segregate
their gross income according to business lines may find it useful to adopt this option.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 3
Under Option 3, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking with a beta factor of 15%
and the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The volume of loans and advances is
used as the exposure indicator for retail banking and commercial banking. Gross income is used
for the other six business lines.

X. External Credit Assessment Institutions
I. Introduction and Scope
1. Banks are required to use external ratings to determine risk weights for certain types of
exposures. However, only external ratings provided by External Credit Assessment Institutions
(ECAIs) that have been recognized as eligible for that purpose by the Central Bank may be used.
This Guidance describes the specific requirements for the recognition of eligible ECAIs, together
with certain other aspects of the use of ratings within the Central Bank’s capital adequacy
framework. Note that additional requirements related to the use of ratings in capital requirements
for securitisation are provided in the Central Bank’s Standards on Required Capital for
Securitisation Exposures.
2. The Guidance is based closely on requirements of the framework for capital adequacy
developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), specifically the requirements
articulated by the BCBS in International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards: A Revised Framework (comprehensive version June 2006), and the revisions from
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, December
2010 (rev June 2011).
II. Eligibility Criteria
3. ECAIs may be considered eligible for recognition if they meet the criteria articulated in this
section. The Central Bank also takes into account the criteria and conditions provided in the
IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies (IOSCO CRA Code) when
determining ECAI eligibility.
4. The Central Bank’s eligibility determination for each ECAI applies only with respect to the
types of claims for which the eligibility criteria have been met by that ECAI.
A. Objectivity
5. ECAI’s should have a methodology for assigning credit ratings that is rigorous and
systematic, and is subject to validation based on historical experience. Ratings assessments
should be based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. Moreover,
assessments must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition.
To establish that an ECAI fulfils this primary component of eligibility criteria, it must demonstrate
that it meets the following minimum standards:
(i) The ECAI has established rating definitions, criteria, and methodologies, and apply
them consistently;
(ii) The ECAI should have a robust procedure of rating assignment based on published
information, market data, interviews with management, and/or other sources of
information that provide a sound basis for purposes of assigning the ratings;
(iii) When assigning risk ratings, the ECAI should take into account all major features of
credit quality that are relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology, and should
ensure that the ratings are assigned taking into account all risk factors of the rated
entity or issue relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology;
139

[Document: document.pdf, Page 142]
CBUAE Classification: Public
(iv) The ECAI should demonstrate that rating methodologies are subject to quantitative
back testing. For this purpose, the ECAI should calculate and publish default studies,
recovery studies, rating transition matrices, or other analyses as relevant to the
ECAI’s rating methodology. The analysis should reflect a definition of default that is
consistent with international standards, subject to possible adjustments to take into
account local practices or institutional or market conditions;
(v) The rating methodology for each market segment, including rigorous back testing,
must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years;
(vi) All rating decisions should be made based on the ECAI’s established criteria and
methodologies, subject to documented variations approved in accordance with the
ECAI’s procedures;
(vii) The ECAI should have a mechanism to review its procedures and methodologies to
adapt them to a potentially changing environment; and
(viii) The ECAI should maintain adequate systems and internal records to support its
assigned ratings.
B. Independence
6. The ECAI should be free from any economic or external political pressures that may
influence its credit ratings. In particular, an ECAI should not delay or refrain from taking a rating
action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise). The independence of an
ECAI shall be assessed on the basis of the following five parameters:
(i) Ownership: The ownership structure should not be such that it could jeopardize the
objectivity of the rating process. For example, the owners should not hold 10 percent
or more of the equity of any entity rated by the ECAI.
(ii) Organizational Structure and Corporate Governance: The ECAI should
demonstrate that its organizational structure minimizes the scope for external
influences to influence the rating process inappropriately. The ECAI should have in
place effective corporate governance that safeguards the independence of its credit
ratings, promotes integrity, and ensures that internal disagreements over ratings are
resolved in ways that do not compromise the overall effectiveness of the rating
process.
(iii) Financial Resources: The ECAI must demonstrate that its business is financially
viable and is able to sustain any commercial pressure that might be exerted by
external entities, including the entities being rated. The ECAI’s financial position
should not depend significantly on the provision of other services to the rated entities.
(iv) External Conflict of Interest: The credit rating process of the ECAI should have the
ability to withstand external pressures. The ECAI should demonstrate that it is free
from any type of external conflicts of interest, or that conflicts of interest are disclosed
and managed.
(v) Separation: An ECAI should separate its rating business operationally, legally, and
if practicable, physically from its other business operations that may present a
conflict of interest, such as advisory services.
140

CBUAE Classification: Public
C. International Access and Transparency
7. The individual ratings, the key elements underlying the ratings, and whether the issuer
participated in the rating process should be information that is publicly available on a non-selective
basis.
8. In order to promote transparency and enable stakeholders to make decisions about the
appropriateness of its credit rating methods, an ECAI should disclose sufficient information (e.g.,
rating definition, methods of arriving at the rating, rating process, time horizon of the rating, and
the surveillance and review procedure) to facilitate such decisions. The ECAI’s general
procedures, methodologies, and assumptions for arriving at ratings should be publicly available.
D. Disclosure
9. A rating should be disclosed as soon as practicably possible after issuance. When
disclosing a rating, the information should be clearly worded, and should indicate the nature of
the rating and relevant limitations, while providing appropriate warning to users of the potential
danger of unduly relying on the rating to make investment or other decisions.
10. To promote transparency and market discipline, an ECAI should demonstrate that it
provides access to information that enables stakeholders to make decisions about the
appropriateness of ratings for the intended use or uses. At a minimum, the ECAI is expected to
make public the following information:
 Code of conduct;
 Definition of default;
 The time horizons reflected in ratings;
 Rating definitions;
 Rating methods;
 Actual default rates experienced in each rating category;
 Rating transition matrices;
 Whether particular ratings are solicited or unsolicited;
 The date of last review and update of ratings;
 The general nature of compensation arrangements with rated entities; and
 Any actual or potential conflicts of interest.
11. At a minimum, the following conflict-of-interest situations and their influence on the ECAI’s
credit rating methodologies or credit rating actions must be disclosed:
(i) The ECAI is being paid to issue a credit rating by a rated entity or by the obligor,
originator, underwriter, or arranger of a rated obligation;
(ii) The ECAI is being paid by subscribers with a financial interest that could be affected
by a credit rating action of the ECAI;
141

[Document: document.pdf, Page 144]
CBUAE Classification: Public
(iii) The ECAI is being paid by rated entities, obligors, originators, underwriters,
arrangers, or subscribers for services other than issuing credit ratings or providing
access to the ECAI’s credit ratings;
(iv) The ECAI is providing a preliminary indication or similar indication of credit quality to
an entity, obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger prior to being hired to determine
the final credit rating for the entity, obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger; and
(v) The ECAI has a direct or indirect ownership interest in a rated entity or obligor, or a
rated entity or obligor has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the ECAI.
12. An ECAI should disclose the general nature of its compensation arrangements with rated
entities, obligors, lead underwriters, or arrangers. When the ECAI receives compensation
unrelated to its credit rating services from a party such as a rated entity, obligor, originator, lead
underwriter, or arranger, the ECAI should disclose such compensation as a percentage of the
total annual compensation received from that party in the relevant credit rating report or
elsewhere, as appropriate. An ECAI should disclose in the relevant credit rating report or
elsewhere, as appropriate, if it receives 10% or more of its annual revenue from a single party
(e.g., a rated entity, obligor, originator, lead underwriter, arranger, or subscriber, or any of their
affiliates).
E. Resources
13. ECAI should possess sufficient human and technical resources to produce high quality
credit ratings. Evidence of resource sufficiency includes:
(i) Technical expertise of the people should be sufficient to conduct the analysis to
support the assignment of ratings, and to maintain contact with senior and
operational levels within the entities that are rated. In particular, ECAIs should assign
analysts with appropriate knowledge and experience to assess the creditworthiness
of the type of entity or obligation being rated; and
(ii) With respect to technical resources, an ECAI is expected to apply quantitative
techniques and models that can appropriately process and analyze the quantities of
data required to support the rating process.
F. Credibility
14. The ECAI must demonstrate that it enjoys credibility in the markets in which it operates.
Such credibility is gauged on the basis of:
(i) The extent to which it meets the resources requirements stated above;
(ii) The extent to which independent parties (investors, insurers etc.) rely on the ECAI’s
risk ratings; and
(iii) The existence of internal procedures to prevent misuse of confidential information.
142

[Document: document.pdf, Page 145]
CBUAE Classification: Public
G. No Abuse of Unsolicited Ratings
15. The Central Bank may request the ECAI to demonstrate that it has not used unsolicited
ratings to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings. If the Central Bank becomes aware
of an ECAI using unsolicited ratings to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings, the
Central Bank may consider whether it is appropriate to revoke the recognition of the ECAI as
eligible for capital adequacy purposes.
H. Cooperation with the Supervisor
16. Eligible ECAIs should notify the Central Bank of significant changes to methodologies,
and should provide the Central Bank with sufficient access to external ratings and other relevant
data to support initial and ongoing determination of eligibility.
I. Code of Conduct and Regulation
17. The ECAI must adopt and adhere to a code of conduct that is consistent with the IOSCO
CRA Code. The ECAI must be subject to effective supervision on an ongoing basis by a
competent regulatory authority that has adopted a regulatory regime consistent with the IOSCO
CRA Code, and that incorporates a registration system for ECAIs.
III. Recognition of ECAIs
18. The Central Bank’s standards for capital adequacy include mappings that identify risk
weights for various types of exposures using a scale that corresponds most closely to the rating
system used by Standard & Poor’s. This is done for purposes of exposition and for consistency
with the BCBS framework. However, banks should not interpret use of this scale as a Central
Bank endorsement of any particular rating agency. Banks may select among all eligible rating
agencies as appropriate for purposes of determining risk weights.
19. On the basis of information assessed by the Central Bank, the following entities currently
meet the criteria for eligible ECAIs described in this Guidance:
(i) Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services;
(ii) Moody’s Investors Service;
(iii) Fitch Ratings; and
(iv) Capital Intelligence.
20. The Central Bank has concluded that banks can use the ratings of any of the above ECAIs.
Banks should be aware that the Central Bank regularly reassesses the extent to which any ECAI
meets the criteria stated in this Guidance. Banks must take steps to confirm that any ratings used
in capital adequacy calculations are obtained from ECAIs that continue to be viewed as eligible
by the Central Bank. Additional entities may be approved as eligible ECAIs in due course.
21. Based on available information regarding the rating processes of these ECAIs, the Central
Bank has established the correspondence shown in Table 1 between the long-term rating scales
of the various ECAIs. However, if a bank determines that a different mapping is more appropriate,
the bank should use that alternative mapping, provided the results are at least as conservative as
using the mapping below.

22. For certain aspects of capital adequacy calculations, short‐term ratings are used. Based
on available information regarding the rating processes of these ECAIs, the Central Bank has
established the correspondence shown in Table 2 between the short-term rating scales of the
eligible ECAIs. However, as with the long-term ratings, if a bank determines that a different
mapping is more appropriate, the bank should use that alternative mapping, provided the results
are at least as conservative as using the mapping below.

IV. Bank Use of Ratings
A. Bank Use of ECAI Ratings
23. For the purpose of applying ECAI ratings to derive risk‐weights for exposures, banks
should apply the following process:
(i) Identify an ECAI (the “nominated ECAI”) whose assigned ratings the bank intends
to use to derive risk weights for some type of exposure that is subject to an external
ratings‐based approach under Central Bank standards;
(ii) Confirm that the nominated ECAIs can provide reasonable coverage of the bank’s
exposures in terms of the types of counterparties and the geographical regions
covered;
(iii) Document the selection of the ECAI and the analysis demonstrating that the ratings
of ECAI are appropriate for the specific use;
(iv) Notify the Central Bank of the nominated ECAI and of the intended application of the
ratings of that ECAI to the bank’s external ratings‐based calculations; and
144

[Document: document.pdf, Page 147]
CBUAE Classification: Public
(v) Use the ratings of the ECAI within external ratings‐based calculations consistently.
24. Banks must use the chosen ECAIs and their ratings consistently for each type of claim for
which the ECAI and its ratings are approved, and must seek the consent of the Central Bank on
any subsequent changes to the application of those ratings. Banks may not “cherry‐pick” the
ratings provided by different ECAIs, and must maintain records of which ECAIs they use for
various purposes within capital adequacy calculations. Banks may not use unsolicited ratings that
may be provided by any ECAI.
25. When banks use external ratings to assign risk weight to securitisation exposures under
the Central Bank’s Standards on Capital for Securitisation Exposures, additional operational
requirements apply to the ratings and the ECAI that is the source of the ratings.
B. Multiple Ratings
26. If there is only one rating by a nominated ECAI for a particular claim, that rating should be
used to determine the risk weight of the exposure.
27. If there are two ratings by nominated ECAIs that map to different risk weights, the higher
risk weight must be applied.
28. If there are three or more ratings with different risk weights, the ratings corresponding to
the two lowest risk weights should be referred to. If these give rise to the same risk weight, that
risk weight should be applied. If different, the higher risk weight should be applied.
C. Other Considerations in the Use of Ratings
29. External ratings for one entity within a corporate group cannot be used to risk weight other
entities within the same group.
30. A bank must treat a relevant exposure or the person to whom the bank has a relevant
exposure as “unrated” for risk weighting purposes if that exposure or that person does not have
a rating assigned to it by the ECAI otherwise used by the bank.
31. Where a bank is applying external ratings to an exposure that corresponds to a particular
issue with an issue‐specific rating, the risk weight of the claim must be based on this issue-specific
rating. In other cases, the following requirements apply:
(i) In circumstances where the borrower has a specific rating for an issued debt claim,
but the bank’s exposure does not relate to this particular rated claim, a high-quality
credit rating (that is, one that maps to a risk weight lower than the risk weight that
would apply to an unrated claim) on that specific issue may only be applied to the
bank’s un‐assessed exposure if the exposure ranks pari passu with or senior to the
rated issue in all respects. If not, the credit rating cannot be used, and the un‐
assessed claim exposure should receive the risk weight for unrated claims.
(ii) In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer rating, this rating typically applies
to senior unsecured claims on that issuer. Consequently, only senior claims on that
issuer will benefit from a high-quality issuer rating if one exists. Other un‐assessed
claims of a highly assessed issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer, or
a particular issue from that issuer, has a low-quality rating (that is, one that would
145

[Document: document.pdf, Page 148]
CBUAE Classification: Public
map to a risk weight equal to or higher than would apply to an unrated exposure),
then a bank with an unrated exposure to the same counterparty that ranks pari passu
with or is subordinated to senior unsecured (in the case of an issuer rating) or to the
specific issue (in the case of an issue-specific rating) should risk-weight that
exposure using the low-quality rating.
32. Where a bank intends to rely on an issuer or an issue-specific rating, the rating must take
into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure a bank has with regard to all
amounts owed to it.
33. Where exposures are risk-weighted based on the rating of an equivalent exposure to that
borrower, foreign currency ratings should be used for exposures in foreign currency. If there is a
separate domestic currency rating, it should be used only to risk-weight exposures denominated
in the domestic currency.
34. In order to avoid double counting of credit enhancement factors, no supervisory
recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques will be taken into account if the credit enhancement
is already reflected in the rating of a specific issue.
V. Ongoing Review
35. The Central Bank determines on an ongoing basis whether an ECAI meets the criteria for
recognition according to this Guidance. In this regard, the Central Bank conducts periodic reviews
of each recognized ECAI. Any changes to the list of approved ECAIs or to the established
correspondence between their ratings will be publicly disclosed by the Central Bank in a timely
manner.
VI. Requests for Recognition of ECAIs
36. The Central Bank may consider additional ECAIs as eligible for use within capital
adequacy standards. These additional ECAIs may be identified for consideration by the Central
Bank, or may be identified by banks or by the ECAIs themselves. The Central Bank will evaluate
potential additional ECAIs against the eligibility requirements in this Guidance, under procedures
established by the Central Bank.
37. Banks that identify potential additional ECAIs for consideration by the Central Bank must
provide information about the ECAI that would allow an appropriate evaluation by the Central
Bank according to this Guidance. The banks should identify the types of claims to which the ECAIs
ratings might be applied, as well as the geographies covered, and explain the need for, or value
of, recognizing the ECAI as eligible. Banks should provide a preliminary evaluation, subject to
Central Bank review, of how the ECAI meets all of the eligibility criteria described above in this
Guidance.
38. ECAIs may also request recognition from the Central Bank. In such cases, the ECAI must
provide detailed information that would allow a complete evaluation by the Central Bank under
this Guidance. The ECAI should provide evidence, subject to Central Bank review, that the ECAI
meets all of the eligibility criteria described above in this Guidance, including full compliance with
the IOSCO CRA Code.

VII. Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: What is meant by “international standards” in connection with the definition
of default?
The most widely accepted international standards for assessing the capital adequacy of banks,
i.e. the Basel framework, incorporate specific definitions of default for wholesale and retail credit.
ECAI definitions of default should broadly reflect those definitions, although they need not
precisely duplicate the Basel definitions.
Question 2: Can definitions of default be adjusted to take into account local practices or
institutional or market conditions?
Yes, as the Guidance notes, certain adjustments for local conditions may be appropriate,
particularly to account for default conditions that should be interpreted as demonstrating that a
borrower is “unlikely to pay.” As the BCBS has noted in guidance to banks, some flexibility in the
definition of default is appropriate to reflect the particular circumstances of each jurisdiction.
Question 3: Must the quantitative back testing of ratings outcomes incorporate an analysis
of recovery rates in all cases?
No, the quantitative analysis conducted should be tailored as appropriate to demonstrate the
performance of the actual rating methodology applied by the ECAI. Specifics of the analysis may
differ depending on the methodology; for example, if the rating methodology solely reflects default
probabilities rather than loss rates, then recovery studies may not be relevant.
Question 4: Can unsolicited ratings be used for bank capital calculations?
No, the Central Bank of the UAE has determined that unsolicited ratings do not provide an
appropriate basis for capital calculations by banks in the UAE.
Question 5: Does the recognition of certain rating agencies by the Central Bank imply an
endorsement of those ECAIs?
No, recognition reflects only a determination that an ECAI and its ratings meet the requirements
to be used for regulatory capital calculations as articulated in Central Bank standards and
regulations.
Question 6: Does the requirement that rating methodologies be established for at least one
year preclude new rating methodologies from being introduced?
No, this requirement does not preclude the development and implementation of new rating
methods by an ECAI. However, use of ratings for capital adequacy calculations (as opposed to
other uses of ratings) requires a demonstration of the reliability of the ratings. Demonstration of
reliability takes time; one year of experience is the minimum requirement, and longer periods of
observation, perhaps operating in parallel with previous rating methodologies, are preferable.
Question 7: Do ratings correspond to specific risk weights for capital, and if so where is
that correspondence found?
Yes, the purpose of recognition of ECAIs and the alignment of their ratings as specified in the
Guidance is to facilitate the use of these ratings for risk-weight assignments in regulatory capital
adequacy calculations. Please consult the relevant Standards (such as the Standards on Credit
Risk) for risk weights corresponding to each rating category.
