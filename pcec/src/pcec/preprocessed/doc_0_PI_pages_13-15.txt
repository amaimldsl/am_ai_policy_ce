The following table illustrates how to calculate the amount of capital issued by Bank S to include
in consolidated capital, following the calculation procedure set out in paragraphs 35 to 41 of the
Tier Capital Supply Standards.
Bank S: amount of capital issued to third parties included in the consolidated capital.

The following table summarizes the components of capital for the consolidated group based on
the amounts calculated in the table above. Additional Tier 1 is calculated as the difference
between Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 and Tier 2 is the difference between Total Capital and
Tier 1.
Bank S: amount of capital issued to third parties included in the consolidated capital.

Appendix 5: Threshold Deduction
This Appendix is meant to clarify the reporting of threshold deduction and calculation of the 10%
limit on significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions
(banks, insurance and other financial entities); and the 10% limit on deferred tax assets arising
from temporary differences.
CET1 Capital (prior to regulatory deductions) 1000
Regulatory deductions: 300
Total CET1 after the regulatory adjustments above (CET1C) 700
Total amount of significant investments in the common share of banking, financial
and insurance entities 150
Total amount of Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 150
DTA that rely on future profitability Significant investments in the
and arise from temporary difference unconsolidated financial institutions

CET1* = 400 (1000-300-150-150) or

*This is a “hypothetical” amount of CET1 that is used only for the purpose of determining the
deduction of above two items for the aggregate limit. Amount of CET1 = Total CET1 (prior to
deduction) – All the deduction except the threshold deduction (i.e. all deduction outlined in para
44 to 68 of the Tier Capital Supply Standards) minus the total amount of both DTA that rely on
future profitability and arise from temporary difference and significant investments in the
unconsolidated financial institutions.

Appendix 6: Effective Countercyclical Buffer
Assume a bank has the following capital ratios
Capital Base Minimum Capital Bank's Capital Ratio
Requirements
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 7.00% 9.50%
Tier 1 Capital Ratio 8.50% 0.00%
Tier 2 Capital Ratio 2.00% 4.00%
Total Capital Ratio 10.50% 13.50%
From the above table, the bank has fulfilled all minimum capital requirements. In addition, the
bank has to meet the additional capital buffers:
Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) 2.50%
Countercyclical Buffer 0.00%
D- SIB 1.00%
Aggregated Buffer requirement (effective CCB) 3.50%
The table below shows the adjusted quartiles accordingly:
Freely available Minimum Capital Conservation
CET 1 Ratio Ratios (expressed as a percentage of
earnings)
Within 1st quartile of buffer: 0.0 % - 0.875% 100 %
Within 2nd quartile of buffer: > 0.875% - 1.75% 80 %
Within 3rd quartile of buffer: > 1.75% - 2.625% 60 %
Within 4th quartile of buffer: > 2.625% - 3.5% 40 %
Above top of the buffer: > 3.5% 0 %
As the bank does not have Additional Tier 1, the bank has to use 8.5% of its available CET1 to
fulfill the minimum Tier 1 requirement of 8.5%. Only the proportion of CET1 that is not allocated
to fulfill the minimum capital requirements is freely available to fulfill the buffer requirement. For
this bank, 1% CET1 is freely available, because the bank already used 8.5% of its CET1 to fulfill
the Tier 1 ratio. (9.5% available CET1 - 8.5% CET1 required to fulfill the Tier 1 minimum
requirement of 8.5%).
Impact: The bank breaches the effective CCB with 1% freely available CET1. Capital conservation
is required by at least 80% of the bank’s earnings. Distributions to shareholders is limited to
maximal 20% of the bank’s earnings (Central Bank approval of dividends still required).
