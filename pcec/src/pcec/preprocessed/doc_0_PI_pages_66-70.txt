banks in a robust and prudent manner at this time. Accordingly, the Central Bank has determined
that CVA approaches that rely on banks’ internal CVA models, or that use inputs derived from
those models, are not appropriate for use in regulatory capital calculations by UAE banks.

II. Clarifications
A. Scope
The CVA standards covers all of a bank’s non-centrally cleared derivative exposures. In
the context of the CVA standards, derivatives are instruments whose value is based upon the
price or value associated with an underlying reference entity. In general, derivatives exhibit the
following abstract characteristics:
 The transactions generate a current exposure or market value.
 The transactions have an associated random future market value based on market
variables.
 The transactions have contractual terms that provide for an exchange of payments
or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment.
 The transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty.
Other common characteristics of derivative transactions may include the following:
 Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure, and may be inherent in the nature
of some transactions.
 Netting may be used to mitigate risk or to simplify operational aspects of the
transaction.
 Positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), with the value
dependent on market variables or their changes.
 Margin payments may be employed, with margin held in various forms, and with
re-margining agreements that allow for the adjustment of margin either daily or at
some other established frequency.
In addition, the Central Bank has used national discretion to include securities financing
transactions (SFTs) – transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase
agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions – within the scope
of the CVA calculation. However, as the Standards note, if the Central Bank determines that SFT
exposures at any individual bank are not a material source of CVA risk, the Central Bank may
direct the bank to exclude SFTs from CVA capital calculations.
Consistent with the BCBS framework, all derivative transactions for which a central
counterparty is the direct counterparty are excluded from the CVA capital calculation. Banks must
calculate RWA for those centrally cleared transactions as specified in the Central Bank’s CCR
Standards.
B. CVA Overview
The Central Bank’s approach to minimum required capital for CVA risk is based closely on the
standardised approach to CVA risk capital described in Basel III: A global regulatory framework
for more resilient banks and banking systems (BCBS 189, December 2010, rev June 2011). A
few elements also draw on clarifications and other information provided in BCBS publications
responding to Frequently Asked Questions, or clarifications contained in Basel III: Finalising
post-crisis reforms published by the BCBS in December 2017.

Regulatory CVA may differ from the CVA calculated under IFRS or other accounting
standards. In particular, regulatory CVA excludes any consideration of the effect of changes in a
bank’s own credit risk as perceived by the market. This means that regulatory CVA calculations
do not consider so-called debit valuation adjustments, or DVA.
C. Hedging
The calculation allows banks to recognize the risk mitigating benefits of certain eligible
CVA hedges. The Standards allows only certain types of instruments to serve as eligible hedges
for CVA, specifically an index credit default swap (CDS), or a single-name CDS, single-name
contingent CDS, or equivalent hedging instrument that directly references the counterparty being
hedged. An option on an eligible CDS (that is, a swaption on such a CDS) can be eligible, provided
the swaption does not contain a “knock out” clause that terminates the swaption in the case of a
credit event. Eligible hedges that are included in the CVA capital charge are removed from the
bank’s market risk capital calculation.
Other types of instruments must not be reflected as hedges within the calculation of the
CVA capital charge, even if the bank views them as mitigating counterparty credit risk. For
example, tranched or nth-to-default CDS instruments are not eligible CVA hedges. These instead
must be treated as any other similar instrument in the bank’s portfolio for regulatory capital
purposes.
In addition to the restrictions regarding the types of instruments that a bank may recognize
as CVA hedges, only transactions entered into explicitly for the purpose of hedging the
counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk can be eligible hedges. This means, for
example, that a bank might have a single-name CDS referencing an OTC counterparty in its
portfolio, and yet that CDS would not be eligible to offset the single-name CVA exposure within
the CVA calculation if that CDS was not originated or acquired as part of the bank’s process to
manage CVA risk for that particular counterparty.
To clearly demonstrate intent to manage CVA risk, the bank should have a documented
CVArisk management process or program, so that any CVA hedging transaction is demonstrably
consistent with the design and operation of that program, was entered into with the intent to
mitigate the counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk, and continues to be managed by
the bank in a manner consistent with that intent. The Central Bank expects that any bank wishing
to recognize the benefits of hedges in CVA capital calculations will maintain policies and
procedures to govern this process. If the Central Bank concludes that a bank’s CVA hedging
policies and procedures are inadequate, the Central Bank may limit the bank’s ability to recognize
hedges in CVA capital calculations.
Another key principle for CVA hedging is that risk mitigation should transfer risk to third
parties external to the bank. Some banks use internal transactions to transfer risk between
different desks or business units within the bank as part of a broader risk management program,
with these transactions typically subject to some type of internal transfer pricing mechanism. Such
transactions are permissible and can be a valid component of the management of CVA risk within
a bank, but the risk ultimately should be transferred out of the bank, which generally requires a
corresponding external transaction to reduce CVA risk.

D. CVA Capital Concept
The standardised approach for calculation of CVA capital is a form of a value-at-risk
calculation, an approach commonly used to set capital requirements. Changes in CVA can be
viewed as following some distribution, such as the normal distribution illustrated in Figure 2.
Conceptually, the general approach to CVA capital is to estimate a level of CVA losses that should
be expected to be exceeded no more than a given percentage of the time. The CVA capital
calculation reflects a value-at-risk calculation with a one-year, 99% confidence level for CVA risk.
Assuming a normal distribution (or equivalently, a log-normal distribution for the underlying risk
factors), losses can be expected to be within 2.33 standard deviations of the mean 99% of the
time. That concept is illustrated in Figure 2, where the 1% negative tail of the distribution has been
highlighted (in this case,  is the standard deviation).
Figure 2
Accordingly, the general form of the CVA capital calculation depends on the standard
deviation of CVA losses:
CVA capital = 2.33 × 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
= 2.33 × √𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
The normality assumption, together with a desired 99% confidence level, is the reason for the
inclusion of a 2.33 multiplication factor in the CVA capital formula. Other elements of the CVA
capital calculation reflect a theoretical approximation of the variance of changes in CVA.
E. CVA Capital Formula
In the BCBS publication of Basel III, banks using the standardised approach to calculate
CVA capital are to use the following formula:
The Central Bank’s CVA calculation, while based directly on the BCBS formula and
producing the same result, uses different (generally simpler) notation. The nature of, and
motivation for, the main notational differences are explained in this section.

A minor difference in notation is the omission of the multiplicative term “√ℎ” from the BCBS
formulation. This term was included by the BCBS to allow the CVA capital calculation to be
adjusted to an appropriate prudential horizon. However, in the ultimate calibration of the CVA
calculation the horizon h was established at one year, and hence h=1. Since the square root of 1
is also 1, and the term is a multiplicative factor, it has no impact on the resulting capital. Some
other jurisdictions have recognized this fact, and have omitted the √ℎ from the CVA calculation
for simplicity in their published capital regulations. The Central Bank has followed this approach.
Another difference between the BCBS notation and thepresentation of the formula in the
Standards is the concept of “single-name exposure” or SNE. Under the Standards, a bank
calculates SNE for each counterparty as:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 − 𝐻 ×𝐷𝐹
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝐻
In this calculation, 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the bank’s total exposure to counterparty “i” across all derivatives
netting sets plus the co𝑖 unterparty exposure measure arising from SFTs with that counterparty,
and H is the total notional of eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. (The symbol
i
H is used in place of B in the BCBS formula, an appropriate adjustment of notation since it reflects
hedge instruments. DF is a supervisory discount factor, described further below.) In effect, the
discounted value of the individual counterparty exposure is offset by the discounted value of
eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. The Central Bank regards SNE as a useful
concept, because it reflects single-name exposure net of hedges. Its use also simplifies
presentation of the CVA capital formulas.
The form of the supervisory discount factor DF in the Standards differs somewhat from
the corresponding BCBS notation. Specifically, DF is defined in the CVA Standards as:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
𝐷𝐹 =
0.05
This form of DF is in effect the continuous-time present value of an M-period annuity of one AED
discounted at a rate of 5%.
