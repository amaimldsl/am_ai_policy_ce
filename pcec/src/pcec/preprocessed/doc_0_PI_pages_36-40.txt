IV. Counterparty Credit Risk
I. Introduction
1. In March 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a new
approach for measurement of counterparty credit risk exposure associated with OTC derivatives,
exchange-traded derivatives, and long settlement transactions, the standardised approach for
CCR (SA-CCR). The approach in the Central Bank’s Standards for CCR closely follows the SA-
CCR as developed by theBCBS in all material areas of substance.
2. The BCBS developed the SA-CCR to replace the two previous non-internal model
methods, the Current Exposure Method (CEM) and the Standardized Method (SM). The SA-CCR
was designed to be more risk sensitive than CEM and SM. It accurately recognizes the effects of
collateralization and recognizes a benefit from over-collateralization. It also provides incentives
for centralized clearing of derivative transactions.
3. As is the case with the CEM, under the SA-CCR the exposure at default (EAD) is
calculated as the sum of two components: (i) replacement cost (RC), which reflects the current
value of the exposure adjusted for the effects of net collateral including thresholds, minimum
transfer amounts, and independent amounts; and (ii) potential future exposure (PFE), which
reflects the potential increase in exposure until the closure or replacement of the transactions.
The PFE portion consists of a multiplier that accounts for over-collateralization, and an aggregate
add-on derived from the summation of add-ons for each asset class (interest rate, foreign
exchange, credit, equity, and commodity), which in turn are calculated at the hedging set level.
II. Clarifications
A. Replacement Cost
4. Note that in mathematical terms, replacement cost for un-margined transactions is
calculated as:
𝑅𝐶 = max(𝑉 − 𝐶; 0)
where RC is replacement cost, V is the total current market value of all derivative contracts in the
netting set combined, and C is the net value of collateral for the netting set, after application of
relevant haircuts. (In the CCR Standards, the quantity V-C is referred to as the Net Current Value,
or NCV.)
5. For margined transactions, the calculation becomes:
𝑅𝐶 = max(𝑉 − 𝐶; 𝑇𝐻 + 𝑀𝑇𝐴 − 𝑁𝐼𝐶𝐴; 0)
where TH is the threshold level of variation that would require a transfer of collateral, MTA is the
minimum transfer amount of the collateral, and NICA is the Net Independent Collateral Amount
equal to the difference between the value of any independent collateral posted by a counterparty
and any independent collateral posted by the bank for that counterparty, excluding any collateral
that the bank has posted to a segregated, bankruptcy remote account.

6. When determining the RC component of a netting set, the netting contract must not contain
any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty
to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if
the defaulting party is a net creditor.
B. Netting
7. The Standards requires that a bank should apply netting only when it can satisfy the
Central Bank that netting is appropriate, according to the specific requirements established in the
Standards. Banks should recognize that this requirement would likely be difficult to meet in the
case of trades conducted in jurisdictions lacking clear legal recognition of netting, which at present
is the case in the UAE.
8. If netting is not recognized, then netting sets still should be used for the calculation.
However, since each netting set must contain only trades that can be netted, each netting set is
likely to consist of a single transaction. The calculations of EAD can still be performed, although
they simplify considerably.
9. Note that there may be more than one netting set for a given counterparty. In that case,
the CCR calculations should be performed for each netting set individually. The individual netting
set calculations can be aggregated to the counterparty level for reporting or other purposes.
C. PFE Multiplier
10. For the multiplier of the PFE component, when the collateral held is less than the net
market value of the derivative contracts (“under-collateralization”), the current replacement cost
is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full value of
the aggregate add-on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of the
derivative contracts (“over-collateralization”), the current replacement cost is zero and the
multiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-
on).
D. Supervisory Duration
11. The Supervisory Duration calculation required in the Standards is in effect the present
value of a continuous-time annuity of unit nominal value, discounted at a rate of 5%. The implied
annuity is received between dates S and E (the start date and the end date, respectively), and
the present value is taken to the current date.
12. For interest rate and credit derivatives, the supervisory measure of duration depends on
each transaction’s start date S and end date E. The following Table presents example
transactions and illustrates the values of S and E, expressed in years, which would be associated
with each transaction, together with the maturity M of the transaction.

13. Note there is a distinction between the period spanned by the underlying transaction and
the remaining maturity of the derivative contract. For example, a European interest rate swaption
with expiry of 1 year and the term of the underlying swap of 5 years has S=1 year and E=6 years.
An interest rate swap, or an index CDS, maturing in 10 years has S=0 years and E=10 years. The
parameters S and E are only used for interest rate derivatives and credit-related derivatives.
E. Aggregation of Maturity Category Effective Notional Amounts
14. The Standards allows banks to choose between two options for aggregating the effective
notional amounts that are calculated for each maturity category for interest rate derivatives. The
primary formula is thefollowing:
√𝐷12+𝐷22+𝐷32+1.4×(𝐷1×𝐷2)+1.4×(𝐷2×𝐷3)+0.6×(𝐷1×𝐷3)
15. In this formula, D1 is the effective notional amount for maturity category 1, D2 is the
effective notional amount for maturity category 2, and D3 is the effective notional amount for
maturity category 3. As defined in the Standards, maturity category 1 is less than one year,
maturity category 2 is one to five years, and maturity category 3 is more than five years.
16. As an alternative, the bank may choose to combine the effective notional values as the
simple sum of the absolute values of D1, D2, and D3 within a hedging set, which has the effect
of ignoring potential diversification benefits. That is, as an alternative to the calculation above, the
bank may calculate:
|𝐷1|+|𝐷2|+|𝐷3|
This alternative is a simpler calculation, but is more conservative in the sense that it always
produces a larger result. To see this, note that the two calculations would give identical results
only if the values 1.4 and 0.6 in the first formula are replaced with the value 2.0. Since the actual
coefficient values are smaller than 2.0, the first formula gives a smaller result than the second
formula. Choosing the second formula is equivalent to choosing to use the first formula with the
39

1.4 and 0.6 values replaced by 2.0, increasing measured CCR exposure and therefore minimum
required capital.
F. Maturity Factor
17. Note that the Standards requires the use of a standard 250-day trading or business year
for the calculation of the maturity factor and the MPOR. The view of the Central Bank is that a
single, standardised definition of one year for this purpose will enhance comparability across
banks and over time. However, the BCBS has indicated that the number of business days used
for the purpose of determining the maturity factor be calculated appropriately for each transaction,
taking into account the market conventions of the relevant jurisdiction. If a bank believes that use
of a different definition of one year is appropriate, or would significantly reduce its compliance
burden, the bank may discuss the matter with bank supervisors.
G. Delta Adjustment
18. Supervisory delta adjustments reflect the fact that the notional value of a transaction is not
by itself a good indication of the associated risk. In particular, exposure to future market
movements depends on the direction of the transaction and any non-linearity in the structure.
19. With respect to direction, a derivative may be long exposure to the underlying risk factor
(price, rate, volatility, etc.), in which case the value of the derivative will move in the same direction
as the underlying – gaining value with increases, losing value with decreases – and the delta is
positive to reflect this relationship. The alternative is that a derivative may be short exposure to
the underlying risk factor, in which case the value of the derivative moves opposite to the
underlying – losing value with increases, and gaining value with decreases – and thus the delta
is negative.
20. The non-linearity effects are prominent with transactions that involve contingent payoffs
or option-like elements. Options and CDOs are notable examples. For such derivative
transactions, the impact of a change in the price of the underlying instrument is not linear or one-
for-one. For example, with an option on a foreign currency, when the exchange rate changes by
a given amount, the change in the value of the derivative – the option contract – will almost always
be less than the change in the exchange rate. Moreover, the amount by which the change is less
than one-for-one will vary depending on a number of factors, including the current exchange rate
relative to the exercise price of the option, the time remaining to expiration of the option, and the
current volatility of the exchange rate. Without an adjustment for that difference, the notional
amounts alone would be misleading indications of the potential for counterparty credit risk.
21. The supervisory delta adjustments for all derivatives are presented in the table below,
which is repeated from the CCR Standards. These adjustments are defined at the trade level, and
are applied to the adjusted notional amounts to reflect the direction of the transaction and its non-
linearity.
22. Note that the supervisory delta adjustments for the various option transactions are closely
related to the delta from the widely used Black-Scholes model of option prices, although the risk-
free interest rate – which would ordinarily appear in this expression – is not included. In general,
banks should use a forward price or rate, ideally reflecting any interim cash flows on the underlying
instrument, as P in the supervisory delta calculation.

23. The expression for the supervisory delta adjustment for CDOs is based on attachment and
detachment points for any tranche of the CDO. The precise specification (including the values of
the embedded constants of 14 and 15) is the result of an empirical exercise conducted by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to identify a relatively simple functional form that would
provide a sufficiently close fit to CDO sensitivities as reported by a set of globally active banks.
