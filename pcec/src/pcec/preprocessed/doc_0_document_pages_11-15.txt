Question 13: Criteria 4 and 5 for Additional Tier 1 capital. An instrument is structured with a first
call date after 5 years but thereafter is callable quarterly at every interest payment due date (subject
to supervisory approval). The instrument does not have a step-up. Does instrument meet criteria 4
and 5 in terms of being perpetual with no incentive to redeem?
Criterion 5 allows an instrument to be called by an issuer after a minimum period of 5 years. It
does not preclude calling at times after that date or preclude multiple dates on which a call may
be exercised. However, the specification of multiple dates upon which a call might be exercised
must not be used to create an expectation that the instrument will be redeemed at the first call
date, as this is prohibited by criterion.
Question 14: Can an option to call the instrument after five years but prior to the start of the
amortisation period viewed as an incentive to redeem?
No, it can’t be viewed as an incentive to redeem.
Question 15: With regards to countercyclical buffer, what are “private sector credit exposures”?
What does “geographic location” mean? How should the geographic location of exposures on the
banking book and the trading book be identified? What is the difference between (the jurisdiction
of) “ultimate risk” and (the jurisdiction of) “immediate counterparty” exposures?
“Private sector credit exposures” refers to exposures to private sector counterparties which attract
a credit risk capital charge in the banking book, and the risk weighted equivalent trading book
capital charges for specific risk, the incremental risk charge, and securitisation. Interbank
exposures and exposures to the public sector are excluded, but non-bank financial sector
exposures are included. The geographic location of a bank’s private sector credit exposures is
determined by the location of the counterparties that make up the capital charge, irrespective of
the bank’s own physical location or its country of incorporation. The location is identified according
to the concept of “ultimate risk”. The geographic location identifies the jurisdiction that has
announced countercyclical capital buffer add-on rate is to be applied by the bank to the
corresponding credit exposure, appropriately weighted
The concepts of “ultimate risk” and “immediate risk” are those used by the BIS' International
Banking Statistics. The jurisdiction of “immediate counterparty” refers to the jurisdiction of
residence of immediate counterparties, while the jurisdiction of “ultimate risk” is where the final
risk lies. For the purpose of the countercyclical capital buffer, banks should use, where possible,
exposures on an “ultimate risk” basis.
For example, a bank could face the situation where the exposures to a borrower is in one
jurisdiction (country A), and the risk mitigant (e.g. guarantee) is in another jurisdiction (country B).
In this case, the “immediate counterparty” is in country A, but the “ultimate risk” is in country B.
This means that if the bank has a debt claim on an investment vehicle, the ultimate risk exposure
should be allocated to the jurisdiction where the vehicle (or if applicable, its parent/guarantor)
resides. If the bank has an equity claim, the ultimate risk exposure should be allocated
proportionately to the jurisdictions where the ultimate risk exposures of the vehicle resides.
