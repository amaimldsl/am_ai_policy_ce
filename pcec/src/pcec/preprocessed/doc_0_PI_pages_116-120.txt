position is -4. The capital charge for the horizontal disallowance between zones 2 and 3 is 40%
of AED 1.125m= AED 450,000.
In round 3, we calculate the horizontal disallowance between zones 1 and 3.

In this example, the long position of 1 in zone 1 is offset against the short position of -4 in zone 3.
The matched position is 1 and the net open position is -3. The capital charge for the horizontal
disallowance between zones 1 and 3 is 100% of AED 1m = AED 1m.
After the three rounds of horizontal offsetting, the total charge for the horizontal disallowance is
AED 80,000 + AED 450,000 + AED 1,000,000 = AED 1,530,000
Having completed the horizontal and vertical offsetting, the remaining overallnet open position is
AED 3m, which is equivalent to the overall net open position we calculated across all time bands
when we calculated the first part of the capital charge.

2. Specific Market Risk – Example
Relate to the same example as above.
Given that, the government bonds are AAA-rated and that the qualifying bond is BBB-rated.
The interest rate swap does not incur a specific risk charge. The AAA-rate government bonds
incur a 0% specific risk charge. The qualifying bond has a residual maturity of 8 years and is BBB-
rated, so if has a specific risk charge of 1.6%
The capital charge is 1.6% of AED 13.33m, or AED213,280.

B. Equity Risk – Calculating the Capital Charge
Bank XYZ has the following positions in its equity portfolio for a particular national market.
Company Position No. of shares Market price Market value
(AED) (AED)
A Corp. Long 10,000 35 350,000
B Corp. Short 20,000 25 500,000
C Corp. Short 5,000 50 250,000
D Corp. Long 15,000 20 300,000
E Corp. Short 2,000 60 120,000
To calculate the general market risk charge, we must first determine the overall net open position.
The sum of the net long positions is AED 650,000 and the sum of the net short positions is AED
870,000. The overall net open position is short AED 220,000.
The capital charge for general market risk is 8% of AED 220,000, or AED 17,600.
Next, we must work out the specific risk charge.
The capital charge for specific risk is 8% of AED 1,520,000 or AED 121,600.
That lead to, overall capital charge for this portfolio is AED 17,600 + AED 121,000, or AED
139,200.
C. FX Risk – calculating the capital charge
Below is an example of calculating the capital charge for FX risk.
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency, United Arab dirhams (AED).
Currency JPY EUR GBP AUD USD Gold
Net position +50 +100 +150 -20 -180 -35
(AEDm)
The higher of the sum of the net long and net short currency positions is AED 300m.
The capital charge is therefore calculated as 8% of AED 300m, plus the net position in gold (AED
35m):
Capital charge = 8% of AED 335m = AED 26.8m
Another example;
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency (AED)
Currency EUR JPY GBP AUD SGD
Net position +150 -100 +75 -30 -15
(AEDm)
The sum of the net long positions is AED 225m and the sum of the net short positions is -AED
145m. The capital charge is calculated as 8% of the higher of these two positions, so the charge
is 8% of AED 225m, or AED 18m.
D. Commodity risk
1. Simplified approach
XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s reporting
currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:
117

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 117]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Position Standard units (kg) Maturity
Long 128 4 months
Short -160 5 months
Long 96 13 months
Short -96 4 years
Firstly, calculate the current value for these positons in the reporting currency.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
Further calculation to the position after conversion to local reporting bank’s currency
Position Standard Spot Value FX spot rate 1 Value (AED) Maturity
units (kg) price (EUR) EUR = 4.25 AED
Long 128 5.00 640 4.25 2,720 4 months
Short -160 5.00 -800 4.25 -3,400 5 months
Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
640*4.25=2,720
-800*4.25=-3,400
480*4.25=2,040
-480*4.25=-2,040
Calculate the capital charge, first a capital charge of 15% of the overall net open position in the
commodity is required.
The overall net position is the sum of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 – AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 – AED 2,040 = - AED 680
The overall net positon is short AED 680. This leads to a capital charge of AED 102 (680 * 15%)
Next, a capital charge of 3% of the bank’s gross positon in the commodity is required.
The gross position is the sum of the absolute values of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 + AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 + AED 2,040 = AED 10,200
XYZ bank’s gross position is AED 10,200. This leads to a capital charge of AED 306 (10,200 *
3%).
Now, sum the charges to find the total capital charge for this commodity. The charge for the overall
net open position is AED 102, and the charge for the bank’s gross position in the commodity is
AED 306.
Therefore, XYZ bank’s total market risk capital charge for positions held in this commodity is AED
102 + AED 306, or AED 408.
2. Maturity ladder approach
Recall that XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s
reporting currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:
118

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 118]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Position Standard units (kg) Maturity
Long 128 4 months
Short -160 5 months
Long 96 13 months
Short -96 4 years
Step 1:
First express each commodity position in terms of the standard unit of measurement, and value
in the reporting currency at the current spot price.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
This isdonethesamewayas forthesimplifiedapproach.
Position Standard Spot Value FX spot rate 1 Value (AED) Maturity
units (kg) price (EUR) EUR = 4.25 AED
Long 128 5.00 640 4.25 2,720 4 months
Short -160 5.00 -800 4.25 -3,400 5 months
Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
Step 2:
Slot each position into a time band in the maturity ladder according to its remaining maturity.
Physical stocks should be allocated to the first time band.

Step 3:
Apply a capital charge: of 1.5% to the sum of the matched long and short positions in each time
band to capture spread risk.

*start with the 3-6 months’ time band.
Multiply the sum of the ling and short matched positions by the spread rate 1.5%, to calculate the
capital charge: (AED 2,720 + AED 2,720) * 1.5% = AED 81.6
Step 4:
Apply a capital charge of 0.6% to the residual net position carried forward to the next relevant
time band, multiplied by the number of time bands it is carried forward.
The maturity ladder approach allows for netting between unmatched long and short positions
across time bands. The residual net position in a time band can be carried forward to the next
relevant time band, thus offsetting exposures in time bands further out. Because this is imprecise,
resulting in an “imperfect hedge”; a capital charge is required.
The residual net position in the 3-6 months’ band is short AED 680. This net position is carried
forward two time bands to offset exposures in the next relevant time band, the 1-2 years’ band.

position carried forward.

Step 6:
Apply a capital charge of 15% to the overall long or short net open position.
The net position in the final time band is subject to a capital charge of 15% as to say 680 * 15%
= AED 102
Step 7:
Derive the total capital charge by summing the charges for spread risk, for positions carried
forward and for the overall net open position.
Capital charges AED
Charge for spread risk 142.8
Charge for the positions carried forward 24.48
Charge for the overall net position 102
Total capital charge 269.28
In this example, the capital charge calculated using the maturity ladder approach; AED 269.28 is
significantly lower than that calculated using the simplified approach, AED 408.
E. Options
Simplified approach
A bank holds 100 shares currently valued at USD 10, and also holds an equivalent number of put
options with a strike price of USD 11 (each option entitles the bank to sell one share).
Since these are equity options, they are subject to the capital charges for general market risk and
specific risk according to the standardised framework for equity risk. The capital charge is levied
