VI. Examples
A. Basic Indicator Approach
The Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) is a simple approach for calculating the capital charge for
operational risk. It can be used by banks that are not internationally active, as well as by banks
that are internationally active but may not as yet have risk management systems in place for using
the more advanced approaches for measuring operational risk. Below is an example of ABC bank
and how the Operational risk capital charge is calculated on Basic Indicator Approach
1- Calculating gross income through the table shows part of the income statement of
ABC bank for 2003.
Income statement of ABC bank for 2003
Operating income
Interest income 150
Interest expenses 110
Provisions made 20
Net interest income after provisions 20
Fees and commissions received 80
Fees and commissions paid 50
including fees paid for outsourcing 12
Other income
From disposal of subsidiaries 10
From disposal of available for sale 8
Investments 0
Net non-interest income 48
Total operating income 68
The net interest income to be used in gross income for calculating the operational risk capital
charge after provisions. Normally banks reduce this amount to arrive at the operating income,
however, in the calculation of capital charge for operational risk, net interest income is gross of
provisions.
In this example, net interest income is interest income minus interest expenses.
150 – 110 = 40
While for calculating net non-interest income for calculating operational risk capital charge, in this
example:
Net non-interest income is fees and commissions received (80) minus fees and commissions
paid, adjusted for outsourcing fees paid (50 – 12 = 38). Therefore, the amount will be 42.
2- Calculating operational risk capital charge under BIA
The following table shows how to calculate the operational risk capital charge under the BIA.

2002 120

Income
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement under 19.5 ((390*15%)/3 or 130*15%
BIA
3- Treatment of Negative Gross Income
Below is the calculation of the operational risk capital charge when the bank has negative gross
income for a year.
Amount
Gross income year 1 -120
Gross income year 2 20
Gross income year 3 250
Total of positive gross income 270
Number of years with positive gross income 2
Average of positive annual gross income for 135 (270/2)
the last three years
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement 20.25 (135*15%)
Since negative gross income leads to exclusion of data points for that year from both the
numerator and the denominator of the BIA operational risk formula, it could at times result in some
distortions. For example, a bank that has negative gross income for one of three years might end
up with a higher operational risk capital charge than if it were to have positive gross income for
that year, even if it was a small amount. To ensure that such distortions do not occur, the
supervisor should review and consider appropriate actions under Pillar 2.
B. Standardised Approach
1- Below is small example indicated which to include and exclude in the gross income:
Included Excluded
Provisions Profits/losses from sale of securities
Operating expenses Extraordinary/ irregular items
Gross income for each business line should:
- Be gross of any provisions (for example, for unpaid interest).
- Be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers.
- Exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the banking book.
- Exclude extraordinary or irregular items as well as income derived from insurance claims.
