1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives‚Äô market values at the reference date. Thus, using the market values
indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {20 - 40 + 0; 0} = 0
Since V-C is negative (i.e. -20,000), the multiplier will be activated (i.e. it will be less than 1).
Before calculating its value, the aggregate add-on needs to be determined.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation:
Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate supervisory duration
Calculate trade-level adjusted notional = trade
notional (in domestic currency) √ó supervisory
duration
Calculate trade-level effective notional amount =
trade-level adjusted notional √ó supervisory delta
√ó maturity factor
Calculate effective notional amount for each
entity by summing the trade-level effective
notional amounts for all trades referencing the
same entity (either a single entity or an index)
with full offsetting
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each entity in a hedging set = Entity-
level Effective Notional Amount √ó Supervisory
Factor, which depends on entity‚Äôs credit rating (or
investment/speculative for index entities)
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Entity-level add-ons are divided into systematic
and idiosyncratic components weighted by the
correlation factor
4. Aggregate Aggregationof entity-level add-ons with full
offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting in the idiosyncratic component
Effective Notional Amount
The adjusted notional of each trade is calculated by multiplying the notional amount with the
calculated supervisory duration SD specified in the Standards.
d= Trade Notional √ó SD = Trade Notional √ó {exp(-0.05√óS) ‚Äì exp(-0.05 √ó E)} / 0.05

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade: in particular, since Trade 1
and Trade 3 are long in the primary risk factor (CDS spread), their delta is 1; in contrast, the
supervisory delta for Trade 2 is -1.
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward and swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Thus, the entity-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory
delta times the maturity factor (where the maturity factor is 1 for all three derivatives).

Supervisory Factor
The add-on must now be calculated for each entity. Note that all derivatives refer to different
entities (single names/indices). A supervisory factor is assigned to each single-name entity based
on the rating of the reference entity, as specified in Table 1 in the relevant Standards. This means
assigning a supervisory factor of 0.38% for AA-rated firms (Trade 1) and 0.54% for BBB-rated
firms (for Trade 2). For CDS indices (Trade 3), the supervisory factor is assigned according to
whether the index is investment or speculative grade; in this example, its value is 0.38% since the
index is investment grade.

Thus, the entity level add-ons are as follows:
Add-on(Entity) = SF √ó Effective Notional
Trade Effective Notional Supervisory factor SF Add-on (Entity)
Trade 1 27,858,405 0.38% 105,862
Trade 2 -51,836,356 0.54% -279,916
Trade 3 44,239,843 0.38% 168,111
Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The add-on calculation separates the entity level add-ons into systematic and idiosyncratic
components, which are combined through weighting by the correlation factor. The correlation
parameter œÅ is equal to 0.5 for the single-name entities (Trade 1-Firm A and Trade 2-Firm B) and
0.8 for the index (Trade 3-CDX.IG) in accordance with the requirements of the Standards.

Add-on Aggregation
For this netting set, the interest rate add-on is also the aggregate add-on because there are no
trades assigned to other asset classes. Thus, the aggregate add-on = 346,878
Aggregation of entity-level add-ons with full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component.
Systematic Component 47,462
Idiosyncratic Component 77,344,042,776
Thus,
Add-on = [ (47,462)2 + 77,344,042,776 ]1/2 = 282,129

3. EAD Calculation
The exposure that would be risk-weighted for the purpose of counterparty credit risk capital
requirements is therefore:
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (0 + 272,313) = 381,238
C. Illustration 3
Consider a netting set with three commodity forward contracts. All notional amounts and market
values are denominated in USD. This netting set is not subject to a margin agreement and there
is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below
summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three commodity derivatives.
