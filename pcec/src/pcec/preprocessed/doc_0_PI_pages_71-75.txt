In contrast, the BCBS formula includes the maturity term M directly in the denominator of
the supervisory discount factor, as follows:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
0.05×𝑀
However, the BCBS formula for CVA capital also multiplies by M as part of the CVA capital
calculation. As a result of that multiplication, the M in the denominator of the discount factor is
cancelled out, making the overall result the same as that provided by DF in the Standards. The
formulation in the BCBS text was designed to accommodate the fact that banks using internal
models incorporate discounting into the calculation of counterparty exposure, and those banks
are required to set the BCBS supervisory discount factor to one, while retaining the multiplication
by M. However, since internal-model approaches are not used for regulatory capital purposes in
the UAE, this flexibility is not needed, and the simpler version of the calculation has been specified
in the Standards. If for operational or other reasons a bank finds using the Basel formulation of
the discount factor more convenient, its use is acceptable, provided the bank also multiplies the
resulting discount factor by M.
If the bank uses single-name hedging only, the bank aggregates SNE across
counterparties to calculate CVA capital using the following formula:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
where K is CVA capital, and Wi is the risk weight applicable to counterparty “i” taken from the
risk- weight table in the Standards.
An important insight is that CVA risk has both a systematic component and an idiosyncratic
component. The systematic component reflects the fact that credit risks of different counterparties
tend to be at least somewhat correlated with one another and move in concert, due to a degree
of dependence on the same general economic or market factors. This kind of common risk
potentially can be hedged, but cannot be reduced through diversification across counterparties.
The non-systematic, or idiosyncratic, component of CVA risk arises from factors that affect credit
spreads but are specific to an individual counterparty. In contrast to the systematic risk, the
idiosyncratic part of CVA risk can be reduced through diversification, as well as through hedging.
If a CVA portfolio is diversified to include many counterparties, it is not very likely that they would
all suffer idiosyncratic credit deterioration at the same time, so overall risk is reduced; gains on
some may offset losses on others.
The CVA capital calculation recognizes the difference between these two kinds of risk,
and treats them differently in the calculation. The first term in the square root in the capital
calculation reflects the systematic component of CVA variance:
2
(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
The exposures are weighted and summed before squaring. Holding risk weights constant,
spreading a given amount of exposure across more counterparties has no effect on this sum;
although there will be more individual terms in the summation, the sum will be the same, and thus
72

there are no gains from diversification. The second term in the square root reflects the
idiosyncratic CVA risk:
∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
Here, because the weighted exposures are squared before summing, spreading a given amount
of exposure across more counterparties reduces the total, reflecting the beneficial, risk-reducing
effects of diversifying the idiosyncratic component of counterparty credit risk.
An alternative arrangement of the CVA capital calculation may provide additional intuition:

𝐾 =2.33√0.25(∑𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) + 0.75∑ (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
This form, which separates the factor of 0.5 from the rest of the systematic portion before it is
raised to the second power, highlights the fact that the CVA calculation can be viewed as
effectively a weighted average of two components, a systematic component with a weight of 25%,
and an idiosyncratic component with a weight of 75%. The 25% weight on the idiosyncratic
component is the theoretically correct weight if counterparties have a common systematic
correlation with the broader market of 50%. Note that this form is simply a mathematical
restatement of the capital calculation, yielding an identical answer for the stated case (that is,
single-name hedging only, no index hedges).
The portfolio-level calculation of CVA risk also recognizes that index hedges may reduce
systematic CVA risk. The calculation including index hedges is:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸 −∑𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 ) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
where Hind is the notional of an eligible purchased index hedge instrument that is used to hedge CVA risk,
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑑)
𝐷𝐹 = is the applicable supervisory discount factor, and M is the maturity of the index hedge.
𝑖𝑛𝑑 ind
0.05
Note that the effect of the index hedge appears only in the systematic component of CVA risk within the
square root. Also, note that there is no correlation-related coefficient associated with the index hedges,
analogous to the 0.5 or 0.75 coefficients for the single-name exposure terms. This reflects the fact that an
index CDS closely tracks the market, with a correlation expected tobe near perfect. The correct coefficient
on the index hedge terms in the model would be approximately 1.0, which is the reason for their omission.
The Standards also includes a version of the formula that more closely resembles the full
formula used in the BCBS framework:
2

𝐾=2.33√(∑0.5𝑊 𝑖(𝐸𝐴𝐷 𝑖𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 𝑖− 𝐻 𝑖×𝐷𝐹 𝐻) −∑𝑊

𝐷𝐹 𝑖𝑛𝑑) +∑0.75 (𝑊

(𝐸𝐴𝐷 𝑖𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 𝑖− 𝐻 𝑖×𝐷𝐹 𝐻))
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
In this form, the intermediate calculation of SNE is not used. However, the results of the
calculation are exactly the same as those produced by the formulation using SNE.
F. Maturity Calculation
When computing the maturity M for a netting set, banks are required to use a weighted
average, with notional values as the weights. For example, suppose a netting set with a particular
counterparty includes two exposures, a 2-year swap with a notional amount of 200, and a 3-year
swap with a notional amount of 400. The total notional value of the netting set is therefore
200+400=600. The weighted average maturity would be calculated as:
200 400
𝑀 =2×( )+3×( )=2.67
600 600

G. Risk Weights
Derivatives exposures and CVA hedges enter the CVA capital calculation with associated
risk weights that depend on the credit rating of the bank’s counterparties for the covered
exposures, or on the credit rating of the underlying entity for hedge instruments. In the case of
unrated counterparties or entities, banks should follow the approach applied by the Central Bank
for credit derivatives that reference unrated entities in the CCR Standards, treating them as BBB
rated unless the counterparty or entity has an elevated risk of default, in which case they should
be treated as BB rated.
The CVA Standards follows the BCBS framework in specifying an array of risk weights
that align with an external rating scale that is most similar to the one used by Standard and Poor’s.
Use of this rating scale for purposes of the CVA Standards should not be viewed as an
endorsement of that or any other external rating agency. Banks may use other ratings, and should
map those ratings to the scale included in the Standards using the historical default experience
for the various rating grades as published by the relevant external rating agencies.
H. Risk-Weighted Assets
The formula developed by the BCBS to determine CVA capital reflects a calibration based
on the 8% minimum capital ratio applied in the Basel capital framework. To calculate a
corresponding RWA amount, the Standards requires banks to multiply the calculated CVA capital
by a factor of 12.5, which is the reciprocal of 8%. That is, 1/(0.08) = 12.5. This multiplication is
appropriate even if the Central Bank applies a higher minimum capital requirement to the resulting
RWA, because the purpose of the multiplication by 12.5 is to reverse the calibration implicitly used
by the BCBS to produce a capital number in the original formulation.
I. Threshold for the Simple Alternative
As part of the finalization of Basel III, the BCBS introduced a materiality threshold, and
provided an option for any bank whose aggregate notional amount of non-centrally cleared
derivatives is less than or equal to 100 billion euro to choose to set its CVA capital equal to 100%
of its capital for counterparty credit risk.
To implement this option in the UAE, the Central Bank has established a materiality
threshold of 400 billion AED. Banks with an aggregate notional amount of covered transactions
less than or equal to 400 billion AED may choose to set CVA RWA equal to the bank’s RWA for
counterparty credit risk as calculated under the Central Bank’s CCR Standards. The Central Bank
has determined that this threshold is appropriate for the UAE, and is comparable to the 100 Billion
Euro threshold included in Basel.
If a bank chooses this CDS, it must be applied to all of the bank’s covered transactions,
as required under the BCBS framework. In addition, a bank adopting this simple approach may
not recognize the risk-reducing effects of CVA hedges.
The Central Bank may prohibit a bank from using this simple alternative if the Central bank
determines that CVA risk resulting from the bank’s derivative positions and SFTs materially
contributes to the bank’s overall risk, and therefore warrants a more sophisticated approach.

III. Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: Are all transactions with Central Counterparties excluded from the CVA capital
calculation?
No, only transactions for which the direct counterparty is a qualifying CCP (QCCP) are excluded.
Note that under the CCR Standard, the bank must have a determination of non-objection from the
Central Bank with regard to any specific QCCP.
Question 2: Should debit valuation adjustment (DVA) be netted from CVA for the capital
calculation?
No, DVA cannot be taken into account to reduce regulatory CVA for the capital calculation.
Question 3: What types of transactions can qualify as CVA hedges?
A CVA hedge can be any financial instrument or contract that refers specifically to the
counterparty by name, and whose value increases when the credit quality of the counterparty
being hedged deteriorates. However, the Standards does not permit "nth-to-default" credit
derivatives (index or basket credit derivatives in which payment is made only on the event of the
“nth” default by a reference entity in the basket, rather than the first default) to be used as CVA
hedges.
Question 4: If a CDS serves as an eligible CVA hedge for one counterparty, does it also
create counterparty exposure to the counterparty for the CDS?
Yes, a CDS or other hedging instrument used for CVA hedging also can create counterparty
exposure, and in that case requires capital to cover the associated risks presented by that
counterparty, including CVA. For example, if a bank has CVA exposure to counterparty A, and
hedges that exposure by purchasing a credit default swap from counterparty B, the CVA charge
for exposure to counterparty A may be reduced, but the bank now likely is exposed to CVA risk
on counterparty B.
Question 5: For calculating the weighted average maturity, should we use the original deal
notional values, or the effective notional values per the CCR standards?
Either approach is acceptable, provided the bank is consistent in its selected approach.
Question 6: If there is no valid netting set with a counterparty, how should average maturity
be calculated?
Average maturity is calculated at the netting set level, for each netting set with each counterparty.
If netting is not valid, then the “netting set” consists of a single transaction, which will have its own
maturity per the contractual terms of the transaction. Without valid netting, there may be as many
“netting sets” for a counterparty as there are derivative transactions with that counterparty.
Question 7: To compute weighted average maturity, we have conservatively treated each
trade as a stand-alone netting set. Is this conservative treatment acceptable?
Yes, this treatment is acceptable.
Question 8: When calculating average maturity for a netting set, should we consider each
asset class separately?
Maturity calculations for CVA must be calculated for each netting set, reflecting all covered
transactions within a given netting set, regardless of asset class.
Question 9: If an entity has ratings from multiple rating agencies, which one should be
76

used to determine the risk weight for CVA capital?
If there are ratings from two different rating agencies that map to different risk weights, the higher
risk weight should be applied. If there are ratings from three or more rating agencies that map to
different risk weights, the two ratings that correspond to the lowest risk weights should be referred
to. If these two ratings give rise to the same risk weight, that risk weight should be applied. If the
