and gross of provisions) averaged over the past three years in the following credit portfolios:
Retail loans included for ASA Definitions
Retail Exposures to individuals, residential
mortgage loans etc.
SMEs treated as retail Loans extended to small and medium
businesses and managed as retail
exposures by the bank.
Purchased retail receivables Bank finance against amounts due to
bank’s retail clients from third parties for
goods and/or services provided by them
Question 11: What is the threshold to decide a large diversified bank in terms of assets
book size/composition or any other indicators?
Currently, there is no such threshold. The Central Bank will perform an assessment for each bank
applying to qualify for ASA. The qualifying criteria provided in paragraph 28 of the Operational
Risk section of Standards re Capital Adequacy in the UAE, especially the first one (90% income
from retail/commercial banking) are stringent. The Central Bank will review whether the bank
meets the 90% standard to determine whether an additional size cut-off is appropriate.
Question 12: Retail or commercial banking activities shall account for at least 90% of its
income. Please clarify whether this needs to be seen in the current year or an average of
all the 3 years based on which the Operational Risk capital is being computed
Testing the 90% rule across a period of three consecutive years willbe more appropriate.
Question 13: "The bank's operational risk management processes and assessment system
shall be subject to validation and regular independent review". Can we get clarification on
the difference between the validation and the review, and what are the scope and
responsible party for each?
Validation of models and tables must be performed by the internal auditor or by the external
auditor.
Question 14: In terms of the "regular reporting", is an official ORM meeting required? For
example, Operational Risk Business/ Country / Group Committee meetings?
It is up to the bank how it conveys the regular reports to the senior management and the board of
directors, but the evidence of these reports were submitted needs to be documented for example
senior management signatures on the reports.
Question 15: Is operational risk capital charge revision a quarterly activity going forward
or it remains as a yearly activity at the end of the year?
Will it be more adequate if we use current years’ gross income to compute operational risk
rather last year's audited numbers only.
If the quarterly income is audited, the bank should use the quarterly data, which means the same
quarter in the previous two years needs to be taken into consideration or else, the yearly audited
data needs to be incorporated
The standards state only audited numbers need to be used and as such, if the current year’s
income is audited, it can be used as part of the computation
Question 16: Elaboration of definition and scope of Operational Risk should be helpful.
For example, whether Operational Risk includes other risk types such as Fraud Risk,
132

Business Continuity Risk etc.
The definition and scope of Operational risk is sufficiently elaborated in the Operational Risk
Standard of the Capital Adequacy Standards of Banks in the UAE and the Operational Risk
Guidance. If operational risks were not sufficiently covered under Pillar I, then the uncovered
risk should be part of the Pillar 2 ICAAP calculation.
Question 17: As per the definition of gross income, "income derived from insurance" is to
be excluded from the income while computing Operational RWA.
We wouldrequest clarification if this also refers to bancassurance i.e. Bank's commission
income earned on insurance products that are sold on behalf of insurance companies."
Any income which the bank earns out of the bancassurace should be treated as income derived
from insurance.

VI. Examples
A. Basic Indicator Approach
The Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) is a simple approach for calculating the capital charge for
operational risk. It can be used by banks that are not internationally active, as well as by banks
that are internationally active but may not as yet have risk management systems in place for using
the more advanced approaches for measuring operational risk. Below is an example of ABC bank
and how the Operational risk capital charge is calculated on Basic Indicator Approach
1- Calculating gross income through the table shows part of the income statement of
ABC bank for 2003.
Income statement of ABC bank for 2003
Operating income
Interest income 150
Interest expenses 110
Provisions made 20
Net interest income after provisions 20
Fees and commissions received 80
Fees and commissions paid 50
including fees paid for outsourcing 12
Other income
From disposal of subsidiaries 10
From disposal of available for sale 8
Investments 0
Net non-interest income 48
Total operating income 68
The net interest income to be used in gross income for calculating the operational risk capital
charge after provisions. Normally banks reduce this amount to arrive at the operating income,
however, in the calculation of capital charge for operational risk, net interest income is gross of
provisions.
In this example, net interest income is interest income minus interest expenses.
150 – 110 = 40
While for calculating net non-interest income for calculating operational risk capital charge, in this
example:
Net non-interest income is fees and commissions received (80) minus fees and commissions
paid, adjusted for outsourcing fees paid (50 – 12 = 38). Therefore, the amount will be 42.
2- Calculating operational risk capital charge under BIA
The following table shows how to calculate the operational risk capital charge under the BIA.

Income
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement under 19.5 ((390*15%)/3 or 130*15%
BIA
3- Treatment of Negative Gross Income
Below is the calculation of the operational risk capital charge when the bank has negative gross
income for a year.
Amount
Gross income year 1 -120
Gross income year 2 20
Gross income year 3 250
Total of positive gross income 270
Number of years with positive gross income 2
Average of positive annual gross income for 135 (270/2)
the last three years
Alpha 15%
Operational risk capital requirement 20.25 (135*15%)
Since negative gross income leads to exclusion of data points for that year from both the
numerator and the denominator of the BIA operational risk formula, it could at times result in some
distortions. For example, a bank that has negative gross income for one of three years might end
up with a higher operational risk capital charge than if it were to have positive gross income for
that year, even if it was a small amount. To ensure that such distortions do not occur, the
supervisor should review and consider appropriate actions under Pillar 2.
B. Standardised Approach
1- Below is small example indicated which to include and exclude in the gross income:
Included Excluded
Provisions Profits/losses from sale of securities
Operating expenses Extraordinary/ irregular items
Gross income for each business line should:
- Be gross of any provisions (for example, for unpaid interest).
- Be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers.
- Exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the banking book.
- Exclude extraordinary or irregular items as well as income derived from insurance claims.
