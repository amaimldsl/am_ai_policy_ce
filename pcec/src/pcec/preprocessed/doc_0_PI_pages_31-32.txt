deterioration in credit quality and thereby cancellability by the bank.
For exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk, the exposure amount to be used
in the determination of RWA is to be calculated according to the standardised approach for
Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR).
N. Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM)
Only eligible collateral, guarantees, credit derivatives, and netting under legally
enforceable bilateral agreements (such as ISDAs) are eligible for CRM purposes. For example, a
commitment to provide collateral or a guarantee is not recognised as an eligible CRM technique
for capital adequacy purposes until the commitment to do so is actually fulfilled.
No additional CRM will be recognised for capital adequacy purposes on exposures where
the risk weight is mapped from a rating specificto a debt security where that rating already reflects
CRM. For example, if the rating has already taken into account a guarantee pledged by the parent
or sovereign entity, then the guarantee shall not be considered again for credit risk mitigation
purposes.
Banks should ensure that all minimum legal and the operational requirements set out in
the Standard are fulfilled.
CRM treatment by substitution of risk weights
The method ofsubstitution of risk weight is applicable for the recognition of the guarantees
and credit derivatives as CRM techniques under both the simple approach and the comprehensive
approach. Under this method, an exposure is divided into two portions: the portion covered by credit
protection and the remaining uncovered portion.
For guarantees and credit derivatives, the value of credit protection to be recorded is the
nominal value. However, where the credit protection is denominated in a currency different from
that of the underlying obligation, the covered portion should be reduced by a standard supervisory
haircut defined in the Credit Risk Standard for the currency mismatch.
For eligible collateral, the value of credit protection to be recorded is its market value,
subject to a minimum revaluation frequency of 6 months for performing assets, and 3 months for
past due assets (if this is not achieved then no value can be recognised). Where the collateral
includes cash deposits, certificates of deposit, cash funded credit-linked notes, or other
comparable instruments, which are held at a third-party bank in a non-custodial arrangement and
unconditionally and irrevocably pledged or assigned to the bank, the collateral will be allocated
the same risk weight as that of the third party bank.
Simple Approach
Under simple approach, the eligible collateral must be pledged for at least the life of the
exposure, i.e. maturity mismatch is not allowed.
Where a bank has collateral in the form of shares and uses the simple approach, a 100%
risk weight is applied for listed shares and 150% risk weight for unlisted shares.
Comprehensive Approach
Under the comprehensive approach, the collateral adjusted value is deducted from the
risk exposure (before assigning the risk weight). Standard supervisory haircuts as defined in the
31

CBUAE Classification: Public
Credit Risk Standard are applied to the collateral because collateral is subject to risk, which could
reduce the realisation value of the collateral when liquidated.
If the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies, the bank must adjust
downwards the volatility- adjusted collateral amount to take into account possible future
fluctuations in exchange rates.
There is no distinction for applying supervisory haircuts between main index equities and
equities listed at a recognised exchange. A 25% haircut applies to all equities.
Capital Add-on under Pillar 2
While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it gives rise to other
risksthat need to be adequately controlled and managed. Banks should take all appropriate steps
to ensure the effectiveness of the CRM and to address related risks. Where these risks are not
adequately controlled, the Central Bank may impose additional capital charges or take other
supervisory actions as outlined in Pillar 2 Standard.
III. Shari’ah Implementation
Banks that conduct all or part of their activities in accordance with the provisions of
Shari’ah laws and have exposure to risks similar to those mentioned in the Credit Risk Standard,
shall, for the purpose of maintaining an appropriate level of capital, calculate the relevant risk
weighted asset in line with these guidelines. This must be done in a manner compliant with the
Shari’ah laws.
This is applicable until relevant standards and/or guidelines in respect of these
transactions are issued specifically for banks offering Islamic financial services.
IV. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
During the industry consultation the Central Bank received a number of questions related to
the Credit Risk Standard and Guidance. To ensure consistent implementation of the Credit
Risk Standard in the UAE, the main questions are addressed hereunder.
Claims on Sovereigns
Question 1: What does the 7-year transition for USD exposure to the Federal Government
and Emirates Government mean for banks?
During the 7-year transition period, banks are required to have a forward looking plan on USD
exposures to Federal and Emirate governments. Banks shall monitor and manage the impact of
the change in risk weights of exposures in USD on the bank’s capital position. Exposures in USD
as well as the banks’ capital plans will be monitored by the Central Bank.
Question 2: What is the appropriate risk weight for exposures to other GCC sovereigns?
A 0% risk weight is applied to GCC Sovereign exposures denominated and funded in the domestic
currency of their country. However, exposures in non-domestic currencies (including USD) shall
be risk weighted according to the rating of sovereigns.
Question 3: Does the Central Bank allow banks to apply unsolicited ratings in the same
32

CBUAE Classification: Public
way as solicited ratings?
Bank should use ratings determined by an eligible External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAIs).
Only solicited ratings are allowed to be used. The Central Bank only allows unsolicited ratings
from an eligible ECAI for the UAE federal government. All other exposures shall be risk weighted
using solicited ratings.
Claims on Non-Commercial Public Sector Enterprises
Question 4: Can the bank include claims on a GCC PSE denominated in their local currency
under claims of Non-Commercial PSEs?
No, the preferential risk weights for Non-Commercial PSEs are only granted for UAE entities.
Question 5: Do all the seven criteria stated in the credit risk guidance have to be met or
any of the criterion can be met to classify an entity as non-commercial PSE? In addition,
does the bank just follow the so-called GRE list or shall the bank apply the criteria to
classify entities as non-commercial PSE?
To classify entities as Non-commercial PSE, the Central Bank will consider in its approval process
all seven criteria and in principle all seven criteria must be satisfied. A bank may approach the
Central Bank, if the bank thinks that certain entities satisfy the criteria for a Non-commercial PSE
that can be added to the GRE list. If banks have information that would lead to changes to of the
GRE List, banks should inform the Central Bank accordingly.
Question 6: The guidance requires that the bank’s internal audit/ compliance departments
perform regular reviews to ensure the PSE and GRE classification complies with the
Central Bank's GRE list. What is the expected frequency of such a review?
The frequency of internal audit/compliance should be commensurate with the bank's size, the
nature and risks of bank’s operations and the complexity of the bank.
Claims on Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)
Question 7: Does an MDB need to satisfy all of the stated criteria or any one of the criteria
to apply a 0% risk-weight?
Exposures to MDBs may receive a risk weight of 0% if they fulfill all five criteria. However, the
Central Bank does not decide whether an MDB satisfies the criteria or not. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (BCBS) evaluates each MDB’s eligibility for inclusion in the list of 0% RW
on a case-by-case basis.
Claims on Banks
Question 8: For claims on an unrated bank, can the bank apply the preferential rating as
per risk weight table for short-term exposures?
A risk weight of 50% for long term exposures and 20% for short term exposures are applied to
claims on unrated banks. However, no claim on an unrated bank may receive a risk weight lower
than the risk weight applied to claims on its sovereign of incorporation, irrespectively of the
exposure being short-term or long-term.
Claims on Corporates
Question 9: Should loans to High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) be reported under claims in
regulatory retail portfolio or claims on corporate?
33

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 33]
CBUAE Classification: Public
No, HNI classification should be aligned with the BRF explanatory note and should be reported
under claims on corporate.
Question 10: What is the treatment for SMEs and in which asset class are SME exposures
reported?
Answer: Banks have to follow BRF explanatory note 6.21 for the definition of SME. Exposures
classified as SME according to BRF explanatory note, are for capital adequacy reporting purposes
classified as “Retail SME” and “corporate SME”. SME exposures fulfilling all of four retail criteria
as stated in Section III G of the Credit Risk Standard are reported under “claims on retail”. SME
that do not fulfill the retail criteria are treated under claims on corporates as per Section III F of
the Credit Risk Standard.
Claims secured by Residential Property
Question 11: Does the bank have to assign 100% RW for customers with more than 4
properties?
Yes, if a customer has more than 4 properties, a bank has to report all properties of that customer
