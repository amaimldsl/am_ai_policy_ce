maturity category 2 is one to five years, and maturity category 3 is more than five years.
16. As an alternative, the bank may choose to combine the effective notional values as the
simple sum of the absolute values of D1, D2, and D3 within a hedging set, which has the effect
of ignoring potential diversification benefits. That is, as an alternative to the calculation above, the
bank may calculate:
|𝐷1|+|𝐷2|+|𝐷3|
This alternative is a simpler calculation, but is more conservative in the sense that it always
produces a larger result. To see this, note that the two calculations would give identical results
only if the values 1.4 and 0.6 in the first formula are replaced with the value 2.0. Since the actual
coefficient values are smaller than 2.0, the first formula gives a smaller result than the second
formula. Choosing the second formula is equivalent to choosing to use the first formula with the

1.4 and 0.6 values replaced by 2.0, increasing measured CCR exposure and therefore minimum
required capital.
F. Maturity Factor
17. Note that the Standards requires the use of a standard 250-day trading or business year
for the calculation of the maturity factor and the MPOR. The view of the Central Bank is that a
single, standardised definition of one year for this purpose will enhance comparability across
banks and over time. However, the BCBS has indicated that the number of business days used
for the purpose of determining the maturity factor be calculated appropriately for each transaction,
taking into account the market conventions of the relevant jurisdiction. If a bank believes that use
of a different definition of one year is appropriate, or would significantly reduce its compliance
burden, the bank may discuss the matter with bank supervisors.
G. Delta Adjustment
18. Supervisory delta adjustments reflect the fact that the notional value of a transaction is not
by itself a good indication of the associated risk. In particular, exposure to future market
movements depends on the direction of the transaction and any non-linearity in the structure.
19. With respect to direction, a derivative may be long exposure to the underlying risk factor
(price, rate, volatility, etc.), in which case the value of the derivative will move in the same direction
as the underlying – gaining value with increases, losing value with decreases – and the delta is
positive to reflect this relationship. The alternative is that a derivative may be short exposure to
the underlying risk factor, in which case the value of the derivative moves opposite to the
underlying – losing value with increases, and gaining value with decreases – and thus the delta
is negative.
20. The non-linearity effects are prominent with transactions that involve contingent payoffs
or option-like elements. Options and CDOs are notable examples. For such derivative
transactions, the impact of a change in the price of the underlying instrument is not linear or one-
for-one. For example, with an option on a foreign currency, when the exchange rate changes by
a given amount, the change in the value of the derivative – the option contract – will almost always
be less than the change in the exchange rate. Moreover, the amount by which the change is less
than one-for-one will vary depending on a number of factors, including the current exchange rate
relative to the exercise price of the option, the time remaining to expiration of the option, and the
current volatility of the exchange rate. Without an adjustment for that difference, the notional
amounts alone would be misleading indications of the potential for counterparty credit risk.
21. The supervisory delta adjustments for all derivatives are presented in the table below,
which is repeated from the CCR Standards. These adjustments are defined at the trade level, and
are applied to the adjusted notional amounts to reflect the direction of the transaction and its non-
linearity.
22. Note that the supervisory delta adjustments for the various option transactions are closely
related to the delta from the widely used Black-Scholes model of option prices, although the risk-
free interest rate – which would ordinarily appear in this expression – is not included. In general,
banks should use a forward price or rate, ideally reflecting any interim cash flows on the underlying
instrument, as P in the supervisory delta calculation.

23. The expression for the supervisory delta adjustment for CDOs is based on attachment and
detachment points for any tranche of the CDO. The precise specification (including the values of
the embedded constants of 14 and 15) is the result of an empirical exercise conducted by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to identify a relatively simple functional form that would
provide a sufficiently close fit to CDO sensitivities as reported by a set of globally active banks.

In this expression, P is the current forward value of the underlying price or rate, K is the exercise
or strike price of the option, T is the time to the latest contractual exercise date of the option, 
is the appropriate supervisory volatility from Table 2, and Φ is the standard normal cumulative
density function. A supervisory volatility of 50% should be used on swaptions for all currencies.
For CDO tranches:

In this expression, A is the attachment point of the CDO tranche and D is the detachment point
of the CDO tranche.

H. Complex Derivatives
24. The Standards requires that complex trades with more than one risk driver (e.g. multi-
asset or hybrid derivatives) must be allocated to more than one asset class when the material risk
drivers span more than one asset class. The full amount of the trade must be included in the PFE
calculation for each of the relevant asset classes. Asset-class allocation of complex derivatives is
a point of national discretion in the Basel framework, and the Central Bank believes that requiring
banks to identify such trades and allocate them accordingly places appropriate responsibility on
banks that choose to engage in such trades.
25. Examples of derivatives that reference the basis between two risk factors and are
denominated in a single currency (basis transactions) include three-month Libor versus six-month
Libor, three-month Libor versus three-month T-Bill, one-month Libor versus OIS rate, or Brent
Crude oil versus Henry Hub gas. These examples are provided as illustrations, and do not
represent an exhaustive list.
26. Hedging sets for derivatives that reference the volatility of a risk factor (volatility
transactions) must follow the same hedging set construction outlined in the Standards for
derivatives in that asset class; for example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging
set. Examples of volatility transactions include variance and volatility swaps, or options on realized
or implied volatility.
I. Unrated Reference Assets
27. The supervisory factor for credit derivatives depends on the credit rating of the underlying
reference asset. The Basel framework does not provide a specific treatment of unrated reference
assets. The Central Bank believes that credit derivatives on unrated reference entities are likely
to be rare. However, for the sake of completeness, the Standards requires that any such credit
derivatives be treated in a manner that is broadly consistent with the treatment of unrated entities
in other aspects of the risk-based capital framework, through use of a Supervisory Factor
corresponding to BBB or BB ratings as described in the Standards.
28. For an entity for which a credit rating is not available, a bank should use the Supervisory
Factor corresponding to BBB. However, where the exposure is associated with an elevated risk
of default, the bank should use the Supervisory Factor for BB. In this context, “elevated risk of
default” should also be understood to include instances in which it is difficult or impossible to
assess adequately whether the exposure has high risk of loss due to default by the obligor. A
bank trading credit derivatives referencing unrated entities should conduct their own analysis to
examine this risk.
J. Commodity Derivatives
29. Note that the Standards defines the term “commodity type” for purposes of calculation of
exposure for CCR. A commodity type is defined as a set of commodities with broadly similar risk
drivers, such that the prices or volatilities of commodities of the same commodity type may
reasonably be expected to move with similar direction and timing and to bear predictable
relationships to one another. For example, a commodity type such as coal might include several
types of coal, and a commodity type such as oil might include oil of different grades from different
sources. The prices of commodities of a given type may not move precisely in lock step, but they
are likely to move in the same direction at roughly the same time, due to their dependence on
common forces in commodity markets. Long and short trades within a single commodity type can
be fully offset.
