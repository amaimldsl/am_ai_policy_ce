In this example, the long position of 1 in zone 1 is offset against the short position of -4 in zone 3.
The matched position is 1 and the net open position is -3. The capital charge for the horizontal
disallowance between zones 1 and 3 is 100% of AED 1m = AED 1m.
After the three rounds of horizontal offsetting, the total charge for the horizontal disallowance is
AED 80,000 + AED 450,000 + AED 1,000,000 = AED 1,530,000
Having completed the horizontal and vertical offsetting, the remaining overallnet open position is
AED 3m, which is equivalent to the overall net open position we calculated across all time bands
when we calculated the first part of the capital charge.

We have now calculated the total capital charge for general market risk for this example.
Capital charge AED
1 A charge for the net open position 3,000,000
2 A charge for the vertical disallowance 50,000
3 A charge for horizontal disallowance
Round 1: Charge for the horizontal 80,000
disallowance within each zone
Round 2: Charge for the horizontal 450,000
disallowance between adjacent zones
Round 3: Charge for the horizontal 1,000,000
disallowance between zones 1 and 3 1,530,000
net charge for positions in options 0
Total capital charge 4,580,000
2. Specific Market Risk – Example
Relate to the same example as above.
Given that, the government bonds are AAA-rated and that the qualifying bond is BBB-rated.
The interest rate swap does not incur a specific risk charge. The AAA-rate government bonds
incur a 0% specific risk charge. The qualifying bond has a residual maturity of 8 years and is BBB-
rated, so if has a specific risk charge of 1.6%
The capital charge is 1.6% of AED 13.33m, or AED213,280.

B. Equity Risk – Calculating the Capital Charge
Bank XYZ has the following positions in its equity portfolio for a particular national market.
Company Position No. of shares Market price Market value
(AED) (AED)
A Corp. Long 10,000 35 350,000
B Corp. Short 20,000 25 500,000
C Corp. Short 5,000 50 250,000
D Corp. Long 15,000 20 300,000
E Corp. Short 2,000 60 120,000
To calculate the general market risk charge, we must first determine the overall net open position.
The sum of the net long positions is AED 650,000 and the sum of the net short positions is AED
870,000. The overall net open position is short AED 220,000.
The capital charge for general market risk is 8% of AED 220,000, or AED 17,600.
Next, we must work out the specific risk charge.
The capital charge for specific risk is 8% of AED 1,520,000 or AED 121,600.
That lead to, overall capital charge for this portfolio is AED 17,600 + AED 121,000, or AED
139,200.
C. FX Risk – calculating the capital charge
Below is an example of calculating the capital charge for FX risk.
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency, United Arab dirhams (AED).
Currency JPY EUR GBP AUD USD Gold
Net position +50 +100 +150 -20 -180 -35
(AEDm)
The higher of the sum of the net long and net short currency positions is AED 300m.
The capital charge is therefore calculated as 8% of AED 300m, plus the net position in gold (AED
35m):
Capital charge = 8% of AED 335m = AED 26.8m
Another example;
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency (AED)
Currency EUR JPY GBP AUD SGD
Net position +150 -100 +75 -30 -15
(AEDm)
The sum of the net long positions is AED 225m and the sum of the net short positions is -AED
145m. The capital charge is calculated as 8% of the higher of these two positions, so the charge
is 8% of AED 225m, or AED 18m.
D. Commodity risk
1. Simplified approach
XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s reporting
currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:
117

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 117]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Position Standard units (kg) Maturity
Long 128 4 months
Short -160 5 months
Long 96 13 months
Short -96 4 years
Firstly, calculate the current value for these positons in the reporting currency.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
Further calculation to the position after conversion to local reporting bank’s currency
Position Standard Spot Value FX spot rate 1 Value (AED) Maturity
units (kg) price (EUR) EUR = 4.25 AED
Long 128 5.00 640 4.25 2,720 4 months
Short -160 5.00 -800 4.25 -3,400 5 months
Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
640*4.25=2,720
-800*4.25=-3,400
480*4.25=2,040
-480*4.25=-2,040
Calculate the capital charge, first a capital charge of 15% of the overall net open position in the
commodity is required.
The overall net position is the sum of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 – AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 – AED 2,040 = - AED 680
The overall net positon is short AED 680. This leads to a capital charge of AED 102 (680 * 15%)
Next, a capital charge of 3% of the bank’s gross positon in the commodity is required.
The gross position is the sum of the absolute values of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 + AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 + AED 2,040 = AED 10,200
XYZ bank’s gross position is AED 10,200. This leads to a capital charge of AED 306 (10,200 *
3%).
Now, sum the charges to find the total capital charge for this commodity. The charge for the overall
net open position is AED 102, and the charge for the bank’s gross position in the commodity is
AED 306.
Therefore, XYZ bank’s total market risk capital charge for positions held in this commodity is AED
102 + AED 306, or AED 408.
