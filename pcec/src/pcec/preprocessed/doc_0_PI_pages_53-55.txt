(No offset between hedging

sets)
The asset class is interest rates; thus the applicable Supervisory factor is 0.50%. As a result:
Add-on = SF √ó Effective Notional = 0.005 √ó 69,375,513 = 346,878
Supervisory Correlation Parameters
Correlation is not applicable to the interest rate asset class, and there is no other asset class in
the netting set in this example.
Add-on Aggregation
For this netting set, the interest rate add-on is also the aggregate add-on because there are no
trades assigned to other asset classes. Thus, the aggregate add-on = 346,878

Multiplier
The multiplier is given by:
multiplier = min { 1; Floor+(1-Floor) √ó exp [(V-C) /(2 √ó(1-Floor)√óAdd-on agg)] }
= min {1; 0.05 + 0.95 √ó exp [60,000 / (2 √ó 0.95 √ó 346,878]}
=1
Final Calculation of PFE
In this case the multiplier is equal to one, so the PFE is the same as the aggregate Add-On:
PFE = multiplier √ó Add-on
agg
= 1 √ó 346,878 = 346,878
3. EAD Calculation
The exposure EAD to be risk weighted for counterparty credit risk capital requirements purposes
is therefore
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (60,000 + 346,878) = 569,629
B. Illustration 2
Consider a netting set with three credit derivatives: one long single-name CDS written on Firm A
(rated AA), one short single-name CDS written on Firm B (rated BBB), and one long CDS index
(investment grade). All notional amounts and market values are denominated in USD. This netting
set is not subject to a margin agreement and there is no exchange of collateral (independent
amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below summarizes the relevant contractual terms of
the three derivatives.

According to the Standards, the EAD for un-margined netting sets is given by:
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE)

1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives‚Äô market values at the reference date. Thus, using the market values
indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {20 - 40 + 0; 0} = 0
Since V-C is negative (i.e. -20,000), the multiplier will be activated (i.e. it will be less than 1).
Before calculating its value, the aggregate add-on needs to be determined.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation:
Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate supervisory duration
Calculate trade-level adjusted notional = trade
notional (in domestic currency) √ó supervisory
duration
Calculate trade-level effective notional amount =
trade-level adjusted notional √ó supervisory delta
√ó maturity factor
Calculate effective notional amount for each
entity by summing the trade-level effective
notional amounts for all trades referencing the
same entity (either a single entity or an index)
with full offsetting
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each entity in a hedging set = Entity-
level Effective Notional Amount √ó Supervisory
Factor, which depends on entity‚Äôs credit rating (or
investment/speculative for index entities)
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Entity-level add-ons are divided into systematic
and idiosyncratic components weighted by the
correlation factor
4. Aggregate Aggregationof entity-level add-ons with full
offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting in the idiosyncratic component
Effective Notional Amount
The adjusted notional of each trade is calculated by multiplying the notional amount with the
calculated supervisory duration SD specified in the Standards.
d= Trade Notional √ó SD = Trade Notional √ó {exp(-0.05√óS) ‚Äì exp(-0.05 √ó E)} / 0.05

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade: in particular, since Trade 1
and Trade 3 are long in the primary risk factor (CDS spread), their delta is 1; in contrast, the
supervisory delta for Trade 2 is -1.
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward and swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Thus, the entity-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory
delta times the maturity factor (where the maturity factor is 1 for all three derivatives).

Supervisory Factor
The add-on must now be calculated for each entity. Note that all derivatives refer to different
entities (single names/indices). A supervisory factor is assigned to each single-name entity based
on the rating of the reference entity, as specified in Table 1 in the relevant Standards. This means
assigning a supervisory factor of 0.38% for AA-rated firms (Trade 1) and 0.54% for BBB-rated
firms (for Trade 2). For CDS indices (Trade 3), the supervisory factor is assigned according to
whether the index is investment or speculative grade; in this example, its value is 0.38% since the
index is investment grade.
