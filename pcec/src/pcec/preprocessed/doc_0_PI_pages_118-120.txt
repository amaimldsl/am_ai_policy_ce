Recall that XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s
reporting currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:

Long 128 4 months
Short -160 5 months
Long 96 13 months
Short -96 4 years
Step 1:
First express each commodity position in terms of the standard unit of measurement, and value
in the reporting currency at the current spot price.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
This isdonethesamewayas forthesimplifiedapproach.

Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
Step 2:
Slot each position into a time band in the maturity ladder according to its remaining maturity.
Physical stocks should be allocated to the first time band.

Step 3:
Apply a capital charge: of 1.5% to the sum of the matched long and short positions in each time
band to capture spread risk.

*start with the 3-6 months’ time band.
Multiply the sum of the ling and short matched positions by the spread rate 1.5%, to calculate the
capital charge: (AED 2,720 + AED 2,720) * 1.5% = AED 81.6
Step 4:
Apply a capital charge of 0.6% to the residual net position carried forward to the next relevant
time band, multiplied by the number of time bands it is carried forward.
The maturity ladder approach allows for netting between unmatched long and short positions
across time bands. The residual net position in a time band can be carried forward to the next
relevant time band, thus offsetting exposures in time bands further out. Because this is imprecise,
resulting in an “imperfect hedge”; a capital charge is required.
The residual net position in the 3-6 months’ band is short AED 680. This net position is carried
forward two time bands to offset exposures in the next relevant time band, the 1-2 years’ band.

Step 5:

When determining the matched position in each time band, take into account the residual net
position carried forward.

Step 6:
Apply a capital charge of 15% to the overall long or short net open position.
The net position in the final time band is subject to a capital charge of 15% as to say 680 * 15%
= AED 102
Step 7:
Derive the total capital charge by summing the charges for spread risk, for positions carried
forward and for the overall net open position.
Capital charges AED
Charge for spread risk 142.8
Charge for the positions carried forward 24.48
Charge for the overall net position 102
Total capital charge 269.28
In this example, the capital charge calculated using the maturity ladder approach; AED 269.28 is
significantly lower than that calculated using the simplified approach, AED 408.
E. Options
Simplified approach
A bank holds 100 shares currently valued at USD 10, and also holds an equivalent number of put
options with a strike price of USD 11 (each option entitles the bank to sell one share).
Since these are equity options, they are subject to the capital charges for general market risk and
specific risk according to the standardised framework for equity risk. The capital charge is levied
121

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 121 (Overlap)]
CBUAE Classification: Public
at 8% for general market risk and 8% for specific risk, giving a summed charge of 16%.
Market value of 100 shares = USD 1,000
First, multiply the market value by the sum of general market risk and specific risk charges.
USD 1,000 x 16% = USD 160
Then, calculate the amount the option is in-the-money.
(USD 11 - USD 10) x 100 = USD 100
The capital charge is the general market risk and specific risk charge less the amount the option
is in-the-money.
USD 160 - USD 100 = USD 60
A similar methodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign currency, an interest rate
related instrument or a commodity.
Another example for simplified approach
A bank holds 500 shares currently valued at USD 25.50 and holds an equivalent number of put
options with a strike price of USD 26.25 (each option entitles the bank to sell one share).
The capital charge is calculated as follows:
Market value of 500 shares = USD 12,750
USD 12,750 x 16% (that is, 8% specific plus 8% general market risk) = USD 2,040
The amount the option is in-the-money = (USD 26.25 - USD 25.50) x 500 = USD 375.
This gives a capital charge of USD 2,040 - USD 375 = USD 1,665
