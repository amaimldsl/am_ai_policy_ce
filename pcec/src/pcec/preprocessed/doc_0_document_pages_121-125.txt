Step 1:
First express each commodity position in terms of the standard unit of measurement, and value
in the reporting currency at the current spot price.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
This is done the same way as for the simplified approach.
Position Standard Spot Value FX spot rate 1 Value (AED) Maturity
units (kg) price (EUR) EUR = 4.25 AED
Long 128 5.00 640 4.25 2,720 4 months

Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
Step 2:
Slot each position into a time band in the maturity ladder according to its remaining maturity.
Physical stocks should be allocated to the first time band.

*start with the 3-6 months‚Äô time band.
Multiply the sum of the ling and short matched positions by the spread rate 1.5%, to calculate the
capital charge: (AED 2,720 + AED 2,720) * 1.5% = AED 81.6
Step 4:
Apply a capital charge of 0.6% to the residual net position carried forward to the next relevant
time band, multiplied by the number of time bands it is carried forward.
The maturity ladder approach allows for netting between unmatched long and short positions
across time bands. The residual net position in a time band can be carried forward to the next
relevant time band, thus offsetting exposures in time bands further out. Because this is imprecise,
resulting in an ‚Äúimperfect hedge‚Äù; a capital charge is required.
The residual net position in the 3-6 months‚Äô band is short AED 680. This net position is carried
forward two time bands to offset exposures in the next relevant time band, the 1-2 years‚Äô band.

Step 6:
Apply a capital charge of 15% to the overall long or short net open position.
The net position in the final time band is subject to a capital charge of 15% as to say 680 * 15%
= AED 102
Step 7:
Derive the total capital charge by summing the charges for spread risk, for positions carried
forward and for the overall net open position.
Capital charges AED
Charge for spread risk 142.8
Charge for the positions carried forward 24.48
Charge for the overall net position 102
Total capital charge 269.28
In this example, the capital charge calculated using the maturity ladder approach; AED 269.28 is
significantly lower than that calculated using the simplified approach, AED 408.
E. Options
Simplified approach
A bank holds 100 shares currently valued at USD 10, and also holds an equivalent number of put
options with a strike price of USD 11 (each option entitles the bank to sell one share).
Since these are equity options, they are subject to the capital charges for general market risk and
specific risk according to the standardised framework for equity risk. The capital charge is levied
121

[Document: document.pdf, Page 124]
CBUAE Classification: Public
at 8% for general market risk and 8% for specific risk, giving a summed charge of 16%.
Market value of 100 shares = USD 1,000
First, multiply the market value by the sum of general market risk and specific risk charges.
USD 1,000 x 16% = USD 160
Then, calculate the amount the option is in-the-money.
(USD 11 - USD 10) x 100 = USD 100
The capital charge is the general market risk and specific risk charge less the amount the option
is in-the-money.
USD 160 - USD 100 = USD 60
A similar methodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign currency, an interest rate
related instrument or a commodity.
Another example for simplified approach
A bank holds 500 shares currently valued at USD 25.50 and holds an equivalent number of put
options with a strike price of USD 26.25 (each option entitles the bank to sell one share).
The capital charge is calculated as follows:
Market value of 500 shares = USD 12,750
USD 12,750 x 16% (that is, 8% specific plus 8% general market risk) = USD 2,040
The amount the option is in-the-money = (USD 26.25 - USD 25.50) x 500 = USD 375.
This gives a capital charge of USD 2,040 - USD 375 = USD 1,665

IX. Operational Risk
I. Introduction and Scope
This section of the guidance supports the Operational Risk Standard in clarifying the
calculation of the Operational risk capital requirement.
Operational risk has existed since banks have been in business. However, it is only in
recent decades that the management of operational risk (including measurement techniques) has
evolved into a distinct discipline, long after this was the case for both credit risk and market risk.
In this same period, the significance of operational risk in banks became widely
recognised. This development was influenced by numerous high-profile operational risk events
and related losses, along with such factors as banks' greater reliance on technology and
increased use of outsourcing, the growing sophistication of cyber threats, and the pace of change
in the financial services sector.
II. Clarification
Operational risk includes legal and compliance risk but excludes strategic and reputational
risk. The exclusion of strategic and reputational risk is because they relate more to indirect losses,
the definition, measurement and quantification of which would give rise to significant complexities.
The operational risk capital charge represents the amount of capital that a bank should
maintain as a cushion against losses arising from operational risk.
The operational risk capital charge is first calculated using the appropriate approach under
Basel III. It is then converted into a risk-weighted asset equivalent by multiplying the charge by
12.5 and adding the result to the total risk-weighted assets for credit risk.
III. Approaches
The calculation of the operational risk capital charge is covered under the Standards for
Capital Adequacy of banks in the UAE.
The approaches represent a continuum of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity.
The charge is to be calculated using one of the following two approaches:
a. Basic Indicator Approach (BIA)
The Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) is a simple approach for calculating the capital charge
for operational risk. It can be used by banks that are not internationally active, as well as by banks
that are internationally active but may not yet have risk management systems in place for using
the more advanced approaches for measuring operational risk.
While the approach is available for all banks as a 'point of entry', irrespective of their level
of sophistication, Central Bank expects internationally active banks and banks with significant
operational risk to discontinue indefinitely with the Basic Indicator Approach.
The Basic Indicator Approach Components
The operational risk capital charge under the BIA is based on two components:
123

[Document: document.pdf, Page 126]
CBUAE Classification: Public
1. The exposure indicator, represented by the Gross Income (GI) of a bank as a whole.
2. The fixed factor, alpha (Œ±), set by the Basel Committee.
The formula for calculating the capital charge for operational risk under the BIA is as follows:
ùêæ = [‚àë(ùê∫ùêº √ó ùõº)]‚ÅÑùëõ
ùêµùêºùê¥ 1..ùëõ
Where:
K = The capital charge under the BIA;
BIA
GI = Annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years;
n = Number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive; and
Œ± =15%, relating the industry wide level of required capital to the industry wide level of
the indicator.
1. Gross Income of the Bank
Gross income is a broad indicator that serves as a proxy for the likely exposure of a bank
to operational risk. It is the total of net interest income plus net non-interest income of a bank as
a whole. Net interest income is defined as interest income of a bank (for example, from loans and
advances) minus the interest expenses (for example, interest paid on deposits). Net non-interest
income is defined as fees and commissions earned minus the non-interest expenses (that is, fees
and commissions paid) and other income.
Gross income used in the calculation of the capital charge for operational risk should be:
- Gross of any provisions, for example, for unpaid interest. This is because such amounts
should have normally formed part of a bank's income but have been set aside for likely
credit losses.
- Gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers. This is
because outsourcing of activities does not fully transfer operational risk to the service
provider. Outsourcing is the strategic use of outside resources to perform business
functions that are traditionally managed by internal staff. Outsourcing offers the advantage
of access to specialised and experienced personnel that may not be available internally,
and enables banks to concentrate on their core business and reduce costs.
Only sustainable, renewable and recurrent sources of income are to be used as the basis
for calculating the operational risk capital charge. Banks should perform a reconciliation between
the gross income reported on the capital adequacy return and the audited financial statements.
This information should be available to the Central Bank upon request. As such, gross income
should exclude:
- realised profits/losses from the sale of securities classified as 'held to maturity' and 'available
