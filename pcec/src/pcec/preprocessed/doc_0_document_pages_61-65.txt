3. EAD Calculation
The exposure that would be risk-weighted for the purpose of counterparty credit risk capital
requirements is therefore:

C. Illustration 3
Consider a netting set with three commodity forward contracts. All notional amounts and market
values are denominated in USD. This netting set is not subject to a margin agreement and there
is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below
summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three commodity derivatives.
Trade Nature Underlying Position Direction Residual Notional Market value
# maturity (thousands) (thousands)
1 Forward (WTI) Protection Long 9 months 10,000 -50
Crude Oil Buyer
2 Forward (Brent) Protection Short 2 years 20,000 -30

3 Forward Silver Protection Long 5 years 10,000 100

1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives‚Äô market values at the reference date, provided that value is positive. Thus,
using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {100 - 30 - 50; 0} = 20
The replacement cost is positive and there is no exchange of collateral (so the bank has not
received excess collateral), which means the multiplier will be equal to 1.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation, for each of
the four commodity hedging sets with non-zero exposure:

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward & swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Since the remaining maturity of Trade 1 is less than a year, at nine months (approximately 187
business days), and the trade is un-margined, its maturity factor is scaled down by the square
root of 187/250 in accordance with the requirements of the Standards. On the other hand, the
maturity factor is 1 for Trade 2 and for Trade 3, since the remaining maturity of those two trades
is greater than one year and they are un-margined.
The trade-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory delta
times the maturity factor. The basic difference between the WTI and Brent forward contracts
effectively is ignored since they belong to the same commodity type, namely ‚ÄúCrude Oil‚Äù within
the ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù hedging set, thus allowing for full offsetting. (In contrast, if one of the two forward
contracts were on a different commodity type within the ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù hedging set, such as natural
gas, with the other on crude oil, then only partial offsetting would have been allowed between the
two trades.) Therefore, Trade 1 and Trade 2 can be aggregated into a single effective notional,
taking into account each trade‚Äôs supervisory delta and maturity factor.

Supervisory Factor
For each commodity-type in a hedging set, the effective notional amount must be multiplied by
the correct Supervisory Factor (SF). As described in the Standards, the Supervisory Factor for
61

both the Crude Oil commodity type in the Energy hedging set and the Silver commodity type in
the Metals hedging set is SF=18%.
Thus, the add-on by hedging set and commodity type is as follows:
Add-on(Type j) = SF (Com) √ó Effective Notional (Com)

Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The commodity-type add-ons in a hedging set are decomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic
components. The commodity subclass correlations parameters are as stated in the Standards, in
this case 40% for commodities.
Thus, the hedging set level add-ons are calculated for each commodity hedging set:
Add-on(COM) = [( Œ£

Metals Silver 40% 1,800 (720)2 0.84 0.84 √ó (1,800)2 1,800
However, in this example, since only one commodity type within the ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù hedging set is
populated (i.e. all other commodity types within that hedging set have a zero add-on), the resulting
add-on for the hedging set is the same as the add-on for the commodity type. This calculation
shows that when there is only one commodity type within a commodity hedging set, the hedging-
set add-on is equal to the absolute value of the commodity-type add-on. (The same comment
applies to the commodity type ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù in the ‚ÄúMetals‚Äù hedging set.)
Add-on Aggregation
Aggregation of commodity-type add-ons uses full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component in each hedging set. As noted earlier, in this
example there is only one commodity type per hedging set, which means no offsetting benefits.
Computing the simple summation of absolute values of add-ons for the hedging sets:
Add-on = Œ£ Add-on
j j
Add-On = 2,043 + 1,800 = 3,843

Multiplier
The multiplier is given by
multiplier = min { 1; Floor+(1-Floor) √ó exp [(V-C) /(2 √ó(1-Floor)√óAdd-on )] }
agg
= min {1; 0.05 + 0.95 √ó exp [20 / (2 √ó 0.95 √ó 3,843)]}
= 1, since V-C is positive.
Final Calculation of PFE
PFE = multiplier √ó Add-on = 1 √ó 3,843 = 3,843
agg
3. EAD Calculation
The exposure EAD to be risk weighted for counterparty credit risk capital requirements
purposes is therefore
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (20 + 3,843) = 5,408

VI. Illustrations of Replacement Cost Calculations with Margining
Calculation of Replacement Cost (RC) depends whether or not a trade is collateralized, as
illustrated below and in the summary table.

Collateralized and Same as the no margin case, unless TH+MTA-NICA (see
margined definitions below) is greater than the resulting RC
ÔÇ∑ TH = positive threshold before the counterparty must send collateral to the bank
ÔÇ∑ MTA = minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty
ÔÇ∑ NICA = net independent collateral amount other than variation margin (unsegregated or
segregated) posted to the bank, minus the unsegregated collateral posted by the bank.
The quantity TH + MTA ‚Äì NICA represents the largest net exposure, including all
collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral
call.
A. Illustration 1: Margined Transaction
A bank has AED80 million in trades with a counterparty. The bank currently has met all past
variation margin (VM) calls, so the value of trades with the counterparty is offset by cumulative
