permitted to invest in equities directly as assets and to hold cash balances, the mandate allows
the fund to take long positions in equity index futures up to a maximum notional amount equivalent
to 80% of the fund’s balance sheet. Since this means that with 100 in assets the fund could have
futures with a notional value of 80, the total on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures
of the fund could reach 180.
Suppose that the fund’s mandate also places a restriction on leverage, allowing the fund to issue
debt up to a maximum of 10% of the total value of the fund’s assets. This debt constraint implies
that with 100 in assets, the fund’s maximum financial leverage would be at a mixture of 10 debt
and 90 equity, for a maximum assets-to-equity ratio of 100/90≈1.11.
Finally, assume that the value of the bank’s investment in the fund is 20.
For the computation of RWA, the on-balance-sheet assets are assumed to be invested to the
maximum extent possible in the riskiest type of asset permitted under the mandate. The mandate
allows either cash (which has a zero risk weight) or equities, so the full 100 is assumed to be in
equities, with a 100% risk weight.
Next, the fund is assumed to enter into derivatives contracts to the maximum extent allowable
under its mandate – stated as 80% of total assets – implying a maximum derivatives notional of
80. This amount receives the risk weight associated with the underlying of the derivatives position,
which in this example is 100% for publicly traded equity holdings.
The calculation of RWA must include an amount for the counterparty credit risk associated with
derivatives. If the bank cannot determine the replacement cost associated with the futures
contracts, then the replacement cost must be approximated by the maximum notional amount of
80. If the PFE is similarly indeterminate, an additional 15% of the notional amount must be added
for PFE. Thus, the CCR exposure is 1.4 x (80×1.15) = 129. Assuming the futures contracts clear
through a qualifying CCP, a risk weight of 2% applies to the CCR exposure, and no CVA charge
is assessed for the CCP.
The total RWA for the fund is the sum of the components for on-balance-sheet assets, off-
balance-sheet exposures, and CCR:
100×100% + 80×100% + 129×2% = 182.58
Given the total assets of the fund of 100, the average risk-weight for the fund is:
Avg RW = 182.58 / 100 = 182.58%
fund
As noted above, the fund’s maximum leverage is approximately 1.11 at an assets-to-equity ratio
of 100/90. Therefore, the risk-weight for the bank’s equity investment in the fund is:
Risk Weight = 182.58% × (100/90) = 202.87%
Applying this risk weight of 202.87% to the bank’s equity investment in the fund of 20, the bank’s
RWA on the position for the purpose of calculating minimum required capital is 202.87% × 20 =
40.57.

VII. Securitisation
I. Introduction
In December 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a
revised framework for calculating bank capital requirements for securitisation exposures, with
further revisions in July 2016. The revised securitisation framework aimed to address a number
of shortcomings in the Basel II securitisation framework and to strengthen the capital standards
for securitisation exposures held in the banking book. The Central Bank’s Standards on Required
Capital for Securitisation Exposures is based closely on the BCBS framework.
A central feature of the revised framework is a hierarchy of approaches to risk-weighted
asset calculations. The BCBS framework includes approaches based on internal credit risk ratings
of banks. These approaches have not been included in the Central Bank’s Standards, as internal
ratings-based approaches are not deemed appropriate for use in capital calculations at this time
by banks in the UAE.
Consequently, the hierarchy of approaches within the Central Bank’s Standards begins
with the revised External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA), and below that in the hierarchy
the revised Standardised Approach (SEC-SA). For resecuritisations, the hierarchy excludes the
SEC-ERBA, and instead begins with the SEC-SA. If neither the SEC-ERBA nor the SEC-SA can
be applied for a particular securitisation exposure, a maximum risk weight of 1250% must be used
for the exposure.
Calculations under both the SEC-ERBA and the SEC-SA depend to some degree on a
measure of “tranche thickness.” The thickness of a tranche is determined by the size of the
tranche relative to the entire securitisation transaction. In general, for a given attachment point, a
thinner tranche is riskier than a thicker tranche, and therefore warrants a higher risk weight for
risk-based capital adequacy purposes. While credit rating agencies capture some aspects of the
risk related to tranche thickness in their external ratings, analysis performed by the BCBS
suggested that capital requirements for a given rating of a mezzanine tranche should differ
significantly based on tranche thickness, and this is reflected in the Standards.
Under the SEC-ERBA, risk weights also are adjusted to reflect tranche maturity. The
BCBS incorporated a maturity adjustment to reflect unexpected losses appropriately in the capital
calculations. External ratings used for SEC-ERBA typically reflect expected credit loss rates, and
the BCBS concluded through analysis during the development process that the mapping between
these expected losses and unexpected losses (the quantity that capital is intended to cover)
depends on maturity.
II. Clarifications
1. Securitisation
The Standards defines a securitisation as a contractual structure under which the cash
flow from an underlying pool of exposures is used to service claims with at least two different
stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of credit risk. The creation of
90

[Document: document.pdf, Page 93]
CBUAE Classification: Public
distinct tranches is the key feature of securitisation; similar structures that merely “pass through”
the cash flows to the claims without modification are not considered securitisations.
For securitisation exposures, payments to the investors depend upon the performance of
the specified underlying exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity
originating those exposures. The stratified/tranched structures that characterize securitisations
differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in that junior securitisation tranches can
absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to more senior tranches, whereas
subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a matter of priority of rights to the
proceeds of a liquidation.
In some cases, transactions that have some of the features of securitisations should not
be treated as such for capital purposes. For example, transactions involving cash flows from real
estate (e.g., in the form of rents) may be considered specialized lending exposures. Banks should
consult with Central Bank when there is uncertainty about whether a given transaction should be
considered a securitisation.
2. Senior Securitisation exposures
A securitisation exposure is considered a senior exposure if it is effectively backed or
secured by a first claim on the entire amount of the assets in the underlying securitised pool.
While this generally includes only the most senior position within a securitisation tranche,
in some instances there may be other claims that, in a technical sense, may be more senior in
the waterfall (e.g., a swap claim) but may be disregarded for the purpose of determining which
positions are treated as senior.
If a senior tranche is retranched or partially hedged (i.e., not on a pro rata basis), only the
new senior part would be treated as senior for capital purposes.
In some cases, several senior tranches of different maturities may share pro rata in loss
allocation. In that case, the seniority of these tranches is unaffected – they all are considered to
be senior – since they all benefit from the same level of credit enhancement. (Note that in this
case, the material effects of differing tranche maturities are captured by maturity adjustments to
the risk weights assigned to the securitisation exposures, per the Standards.)
In a traditional securitisation where all tranches above the first-loss piece are rated, the
most highly rated position should be treated as a senior tranche. When there are several tranches
that share the same rating, only the most senior tranche in the cash flow waterfall should be
treated as senior (unless the only difference among them is the effective maturity). In addition,
when the different ratings of several senior tranches only result from a difference in maturity, all
of these tranches should be treated as senior.
In a typical synthetic securitisation, an unrated tranche can be treated as a senior tranche
provided that all of the conditions for inferring a rating from a lower tranche that meets the
definition of a senior tranche are fulfilled.
Usually, a liquidity facility supporting an ABCP program would not be the most senior
position within the program; instead, the commercial paper issued by the program, which benefits
from the liquidity support, typically would be the most senior position. However, when a liquidity
facility that is sized to cover all of the outstanding commercial paper and other senior debt
supported by the pool is structured so that no cash flows from the underlying pool can be
91

[Document: document.pdf, Page 94]
CBUAE Classification: Public
transferred to other creditors until any liquidity draws are repaid in full, the liquidity facility can be
treated as a senior exposure. Otherwise, if these conditions are not satisfied, or if for other reasons
the liquidity facility constitutes a mezzanine position in economic substance rather than a senior
position in the underlying pool, the liquidity facility should be treated as a non-senior exposure.
3. Operational requirements for the recognition of risk transference
The Standards requires that banks obtain a legal opinion to confirm true sale to
demonstrate that the transferor does not maintain effective or indirect control over the transferred
exposures and that the exposures are legally isolated from the transferor in such a way (e.g.,
through the sale of assets or through sub-participation) that the exposures are put beyond the
reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or receivership. However, that legal
opinion need not be limited to legal advice from qualified external legal counsel; it may be in the
form of written advice from in-house lawyers.
For synthetic securitisations, risk transference through instruments such as credit
derivatives may be recognized only if the instruments used to transfer credit risk do not contain
terms or conditions that limit the amount of credit risk transferred. Examples of terms or conditions
that would violate this requirement include the following:
(a) Clauses that materially limit the credit protection or credit risk transference, such as an
early amortization provision in a securitisation of revolving credit facilities that effectively
subordinates the bank’s interest, significant materiality thresholds below which credit
protection is deemed not to be triggered even if a credit event occurs, or clauses that
allow for the termination of the protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the
underlying exposures.
(b) Clauses that require the originating bank to alter the underlying exposures to improve
the pool’s average credit quality.
(c) Clauses that increase the bank’s cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in
the pool’s quality.
(d) Clauses that increase the yield payable to parties other than the originating bank, such
as investors and third-party providers of credit enhancements, in response to a
deterioration in the credit quality of the reference pool.
(e) Clauses that provide for increases in a retained first-loss position or credit enhancement
provided by the originating bank after the transaction’s inception.
4. Due diligence
The Standards requires banks to have a thorough understanding of all structural features of a
securitisation transaction that would materially affect the performance of the bank’s exposures to
the transaction. Common structural features that are particularly relevant include those related to
the payment waterfall incorporated in the structure, which is the description of the order of
payment for the securitisation, under which higher-tier tranches receive principal and interest
first, before lower-tier tranches are paid. Credit enhancements and liquidity enhancements also
are important structural features; these may take the form of cash advance facilities, letters of
credit, guarantees, or credit derivatives, among others. Effective due diligence also should
consider unusual or unique aspects of a particular securitisation structure, such as the specific
nature of the conditions that would constitute default under the structure.
92

5. Treatment of Securitisation exposures
1. Risk weights for off-balance-sheet exposures
The Standards requires that banks apply a 100% CCF to any securitisation-related off-
balance-sheet exposures that are not credit risk mitigants. One example of such an off-balance-
sheet exposure that may arise with securitisations is a commitment for servicer cash advances,
under which a servicer enters into a contract to advance cash to ensure an uninterrupted flow of
payments to investors. The BCBS securitisation framework provides national discretion to permit
the undrawn portion of servicer cash advances that are unconditionally cancellable without prior
notice to receive the CCF for unconditionally cancellable. The Central Bank has chosen not to
adopt this discretionary treatment, and instead requires a 100% CCF for all off-balance-sheet
exposures, including undrawn servicer cash advances.
2. Adjustment of risk-weights for overlapping exposures
Banks may adjust risk weights for overlapping exposures. An exposure A overlaps another
exposure B if in all circumstances the bank can avoid any loss on exposure B by fulfilling its
obligations with respect to exposure A. For example, if a bank holds notes as an investor but
provides full credit support to those notes, its full credit support obligation precludes any loss from
its exposure to the notes. If a bank can verify that fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure
A will preclude a loss from its exposure to B under any circumstance, the bank does not need to
calculate risk-weighted assets for its exposure B.
To demonstrate an overlap, a bank may, for the purposes of calculating capital
requirements, split or expand its exposures. That is, splitting exposures into portions that overlap
with another exposure held by the bank and other portions that do not overlap, or expanding
exposures by assuming for capital purposes that obligations with respect to one of the overlapping
exposures are larger than those established contractually. The latter could be done, for instance,
by expanding either the assumed extent of the obligation, or the trigger events to exercise the
facility. A bank may also recognize overlap between exposures in the trading book and
securitisation exposures in the banking book, provided that the bank is able to calculate and
compare the capital charges for the relevant exposures.
3. External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA)
To be eligible for use in the securitisation framework, the external credit assessment must
take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard
to all payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the
assessment must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely
repayment of both principal and interest.
A bank is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk-weighting purposes
where the assessment is at least partly based on unfunded support provided by the bank itself.
For example, if a bank buys ABCP where it provides an unfunded securitisation exposure
extended to the ABCP program (e.g., liquidity facility or credit enhancement), and that exposure
plays a role in determining the credit assessment on the ABCP, the bank must treat the ABCP as
if it were not rated. The bank also must hold capital against the liquidity facility and/or credit
enhancement as a securitisation exposure.
93

[Document: document.pdf, Page 96]
CBUAE Classification: Public
External credit assessments used for the SEC-ERBA must be from an eligible external
credit assessment institution (ECAI) as recognized by the Central Bank in accordance with the
Central Bank standards on rating agency recognition. However, the securitisation Standards
additionally requires that the credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions and
the key elements underlying the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective basis
and free of charge. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a
transaction do not satisfy this requirement. Where the eligible credit assessment is not publicly
available free of charge, the ECAI should provide an adequate justification, within its own publicly
available code of conduct, in accordance with the “comply or explain” nature of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions’ Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating
Agencies.
Under the Standards, a bank may infer a rating for an unrated position from an externally
rated “reference exposure” for purposes of the SEC-ERBA provided that the reference
securitisation exposure ranks pari passu or is subordinate in all respects to the unrated
securitisation exposure. Credit enhancements, if any, must be taken into account when assessing
the relative subordination of the unrated exposure and the reference securitisation exposure. For
example, if the reference securitisation exposure benefits from any third-party guarantees or other
credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated exposure, then the latter may not be
assigned an inferred rating based on the reference securitisation exposure.
4. Standardised Approach (SEC-SA)
The supervisory formula used for the calculations within the SEC-SA has been calibrated
by the BCBS to generate required capital under an assumed minimum 8% risk-based capital ratio.
As a result, the appropriate conversion to risk-weighted assets for the SEC-SA generally requires
multiplication of the computed capital ratio by a factor of 12.5 (the reciprocal of 8%) to produce
the risk weight used within broader calculations of risk-based capital adequacy. This multiplication
by 12.5 is reflected in the requirements as articulated in the Central Bank’s Securitisation
Standards.
If the underlying pool of exposures receives a risk weight of 1250%, then paragraph 5 of
the Introduction of the Standards for Capital Adequacy of banks in the UAE is applicable.
When applying the supervisory formula for the SEC-SA to structures involving an SPE, all
of the SPE’s exposures related to the securitisation are to be treated as exposures in the pool. In
particular, in the case of swaps other than credit derivatives, the exposure should include the
positive current market value times the risk weight of the swap provider. However, under the
Standards, a bank can exclude the exposures of the SPE from the pool for capital calculation
purposes if the bank can demonstrate that the risk does not affect its particular securitisation
exposure or that the risk is immaterial, for example because it has been mitigated. Certain market
practices may eliminate or at least significantly reduce the potential risk from a default of a swap
provider. Examples of such features could be:
 cash collateralization of the market value in combination with an agreement of prompt
additional payments in case of an increase of the market value of the swap; or
 minimum credit quality of the swap provider with the obligation to post collateral or present
an alternative swap provider without any costs for the SPE in the event of a credit
deterioration on the part of the original swap provider.
94

[Document: document.pdf, Page 97]
CBUAE Classification: Public
If the bank is able to demonstrate that the risk is mitigated in this way, and that the exposures do
not contribute materially to the risks faced by the bank as a holder of the securitisation exposure,
the bank may exclude these exposures from the K calculation.
SA
6. Treatment of credit risk mitigation for securitisation exposures
1. Tranched protection
In the case of tranched credit protection, the original securitisation tranche should be
decomposed into protected and unprotected sub-tranches. However, this decomposition is a
theoretical construction, and should not be viewed as creating a new securitisation transaction.
Similarly, the resulting sub- tranches should not be considered resecuritisations solely due to the
presence of the credit protection.
For a bank using the SEC-ERBA for the original securitisation exposure, the bank should
use the risk weight of the original securitisation for the sub-tranche of highest priority. Note that
the term “sub-tranche of highest priority” only describes the relative priority of the decomposed
tranche. The calculation of the risk weight of each sub-tranche is independent from the question
of whether the sub-tranche is protected (i.e., risk is taken by the protection provider) or is
unprotected (i.e., risk is taken by the protection buyer).
2. Maturity mismatches
For synthetic securitisations, maturity mismatches may arise when protection is bought on
securitised assets (when, for example, a bank uses credit derivatives to transfer part or all of the
credit risk of a specific pool of assets to third parties). When the credit derivatives unwind, the
transaction will terminate. This implies that the effective maturity of all the tranches of the synthetic
securitisation may differ from that of the underlying exposures.
7. Simple, Transparent, and Comparable Criteria
In general, to qualify for treatment as simple, transparent, and comparable (STC), a
securitisation must meet all of the criteria specified in the Standards, including the Appendix to
the Standards. The criteria include a requirement that the aggregated value of all exposures to a
single obligor as of the acquisition date not exceed 2% of the aggregated outstanding exposure
value of all exposures in the securitisation. However, the BCBS has permitted flexibility for
jurisdictions with structurally concentrated corporate loan markets. In those cases, for corporate
exposures only, the applicable maximum concentration threshold for STC treatment can be
increased to 3%. This increase is subject to ex ante supervisory approval, and banks with such
exposures should consult with the Central Bank regarding STC treatment. In addition, the seller
or sponsor of such a pool must retain subordinated positions that provide loss-absorbing credit
enhancement covering at least the first 10% of losses. These credit-enhancing positions retained
by the sellers or sponsor are not eligible for STC capital treatment.

III. Example Calculations
A. Standardised Approach
Consider a bank applying the SEC-SA to a securitisation exposure for which the
underlying pool of assets has a required capital ratio of 9% under the standardised approach to
credit risk. Suppose that the delinquency rate is unknown for 1% of the exposures in the
underlying pool, but for the remaining 99% of the pool the delinquency rate is known to be 6%.
The bank holds an investment of 100 million in a tranche that has an attachment point of 5% and
a detachment point of 25%. Finally, assume that the pool does not itself contain any securitisation
exposures, so the exposure is not a resecuritisation.
In this example, K is given at 9%. To adjust for the known delinquency rate on the pooled
SA
assets, the bank computes an adjusted capital ratio:
(1−𝑊)×𝐾 +(𝑊×0.5)= 0.94×0.09+0.06×0.5 = 0.1146
𝑆𝐴
This calculated capital ratio must be further adjusted for the fact that the delinquency rate
is unknown for a small portion (1%) of the underlying asset pool:
𝐾 =0.99×0.1146+0.01= 0.1235
𝐴
Next, the bank applies the supervisory formula to calculate the capital required per unit of
securitisation exposure, using the values of the attachment point A, the detachment point D, the
calculated value of K , and the appropriate value of the supervisory parameter ρ, and noting that
A
D>K :
A
𝑒𝑎×𝑈 −𝑒𝑎×𝐿
𝐾 =
𝑎×(𝑈−𝐿)
Where:
−1 −1
a = = = −8.100
ρ×K 1×0.1234
A
U = D−K = 0.25−0.1235= 0.1265
A
L = max[(A−K ),0] =max[(0.05−0.1235),0]= 0
A
Note that because this is not a resecuritisation exposure, the appropriate value of the supervisory
calibration parameter rho is 1 (ρ=1).
Substituting the values of a, U, and L into the supervisory formula gives:
e−8.1×0.1265−e−8.1×0 0.3586−1
𝐾 = = = 0.6260
−8.1×(0.1265−0) −8.1×0.1265
This tranche represents a case in which the attachment point A is less than K but the
A
detachment point D is greater than K . Thus, according to the Standards, the risk weight for the
A
bank’s exposure is calculated as a weighted average of 12.5 and 12.5×K:
96

[Document: document.pdf, Page 99]
CBUAE Classification: Public
K −A D−K
A A
RW = ( )×12.5+( )×12.5×K

0.1235−0.05 0.25−0.1235
= ( )×12.5+( )×12.5×0.6260= 9.54,or 954%
0.2 0.2
With a tranche risk weight of 954%, the bank’s risk-weighted asset amount for this
securitisation would be 954% of the 100 million investment, or 954 million. If, for example, the
bank chose to apply a capital ratio of 13% to this exposure, then the bank’s required capital would
be 13% of 954 million, or approximately 85 million, on the investment of 100 million in this
securitisation tranche.
B. External Ratings-Based Approach
Consider a non-senior securitisation tranche that has been assigned a rating by one of the
eligible rating agencies corresponding to a rating of BB+. Suppose that the tranche has an
attachment point A of 5%, a detachment point D of 30%, and effective tranche maturity of M = 2
T
years.
 From the look-up table for SEC-ERBA, a non-senior securitisation exposure rated BB+
with one-year maturity has a risk weight of 470%; the risk weight for a five-year maturity
is 580%.
 The tranche maturity of 2 years is one-quarter of the way between one year and five years,
so the relevant maturity-adjusted risk weight based on linear interpolation is one quarter
of the way between 470% and 580%, or 497.5%.
 Because this is a non-senior tranche, it must also be adjusted for tranche thickness, which
is the difference between D=30% and A=5%, a difference of 25%. The interpolated risk
weight from the table should be multiplied by a factor of 1-(D-A)=0.75, which exceeds the
floor of 50% and therefore should be used by the bank in the calculation (0.75 x 497.5%).
 The resulting tranche risk weight is 373%.
Banks using the SEC-ERBA for securitisation exposures may prefer to incorporate the
main features of the ERBA look-up tables into formal calculations of risk weights, including the
relevant adjustments for tranche maturity and tranche thickness. In that case, each pair of 1-year
and 5-year risk weights can be viewed as coefficients for a formulaic calculation of the risk weight
for a tranche of given maturity M , and in the case of non-senior tranches, thickness D-A.
T
For example, for a non-senior tranche rated BB+ with M between one year and five years,
T
the tranche risk weight RW can be computed with a single formula as:
T
𝑀 −1
𝑇
𝑅𝑊 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 [0.5 ,1−(𝐷−𝐴)]×(4.7+( )×(5.8−4.7))
𝑇 4
where the coefficients 4.7 and 5.8 correspond to the relevant values from the look-up table of
470% for one-year maturity and 580% for five-year maturity. Substituting in the values for A, D,
and M from the example above:
T
2−1
𝑅𝑊 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥[0.5 ,1−(30%−5%)]×(4.7+( )×(1.1))= 0.75×4.975 = 3.73,or 373%
𝑇 4
97

[Document: document.pdf, Page 100]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Senior tranches are not adjusted for thickness; hence, the calculation of the tranche risk
weight RW for a senior BB+ rated tranche would be computed as:
T
𝑀 −1
𝑇
𝑅𝑊 = 1.4+( )×(1.6−1.4)= 1.4+0.25×0.2 = 1.45,or 145%
𝑇 4
where again the coefficients 1.4 and 1.6 correspond to the relevant values from the senior tranche
columns of the look-up table, specifically 140% for 1-year maturity and 160% for 5-year maturity.

VIII. Market Risk
I. Introduction and scope
This section supports the Market risk standards in clarifying the calculation of the market
risk capital requirement.
The capital charges for interest rate related instruments and equities will apply to the
trading book. The capital charges for foreign exchange risk and for commodities risk will apply to
banks’ total currency and commodity positions (i.e. entire book).
Capital requirements for market risk apply on a consolidated basis. Note that the capital
required for general and specific market risk under these Standards is in addition to, not in place
of, any capital required under other Central Bank Standards. Banks should follow the
requirements of all other applicable Central Bank standards to determine overall capital adequacy
requirements.
II. Identifying Market Risk Drivers
For a particular instrument, the risk drivers that influence the market prices of that
instrument must be identified. In a portfolio, the correlations between instruments also influence
the risk profile of the entire portfolio (i.e. Banking and Trading book).
The market price of an asset incorporates virtually all known information concerning that
asset. In practice; however, it is very difficult to clearly separate the main sources that influence
an instrument's market price and risk level.
As a simplification, the following are generally recognised as the main market risk drivers:
A. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the potential for losses in on- or off-balance sheet positions from
adverse changes in interest rates. Instruments covered by the standardised approach for interest
rate risk include all fixed rate and floating rate related instruments, such as debt securities, swaps,
forwards and futures.
The standardised approach provides a framework for measuring interest rate risk. It takes
into account the maturity or duration of the positions, basis risk, and certain correlations among
risk factors.
Duration is a measure of the average maturity of a debt instrument's cash flows from both
coupons and principal repayment. It is expressed in years and allows debt instruments with
different coupons and maturities to be compared. Based on the duration, the sensitivity of a fixed
income security's price with respect to a small change in its yield can be determined.
When hedging positions, basis risk is a key risk for the hedged position and needs to be
managed and closely monitored.
Typically, two distinct components of market risk are recognised:
99

[Document: document.pdf, Page 102]
CBUAE Classification: Public
1. General Market Risk
General market risk refers to changes in market prices resulting from general market
behavior.
For example, in the case of an equity position, general market risk can arise from a change in a
stock market index. In the case of a fixed income instrument, general market risk is driven by a
change in the yield curve.
The capital charge for general market risk is designed to capture the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in market interest rates.
There are two steps for calculating the general market risk capital charge:
Step 1: Map each interest rate position to a time band
Interest rate positions have different price sensitivities to interest rate shifts depending on their
residual maturity. Interest rate shifts are changes in the yield curve. Each interest rate position is
mapped to a time band.
There are two methods for mapping interest rate positions:
a) Maturity method
This Method maps each position to a maturity ladder based on the residual maturity of each
position.
Fixed weightings are used to adjust the positions for sensitivity to the changes in interest rates as
per the relevant table under the standard.
Time Bands for the Maturity Method
 Fixed income instruments with low coupons have higher sensitivity to changes in the yield
curve than fixed income instruments with high coupons, all other things being equal.
 Fixed income instruments with long maturities have higher sensitivity to changes in the
yield curve than fixed income instruments with short maturities, all other things being
equal.
This is why the maturity method uses a finer grid of time bands for low coupon instruments (less
than 3%) with long maturities.
Fixed and Floating Rate Instruments
Fixed rate instruments are mapped according to the residual term to maturity. Floating
rate instruments are allocated according to the residual term to the next repricing date.
b) Duration method
This method maps each position according to its duration to a duration ladder. Duration is
a measure of the average maturity of a debt instrument’s cash flows from both coupons and
principal repayment. It is expressed in years and allows debt instruments with different coupons
and maturities to be compared. The duration method allows banks the necessary capability to
calculate price sensitivity based on an instruments’ duration (with the supervisory consent).
Step 2: Calculate the capital charge

The capital charge is the sum of four components calculated from amounts in each time band:
 A charge on the net short or long position in the whole trading book:
 A vertical disallowance charge:
It is a charge, which is levied on the matched position in each time band. This charges accounts
for basis risk and gap risk, which can arise because each time band includes different instruments
with different maturities. Gap risk, or interest mismatch risk, is the risk of losses due to interest
rate changes that arise when the periods over which assets and liabilities are priced, differs. This
charge is levied on the matched position in each time band at:
 10% if the bank uses the maturity method
 5% of the bank uses the duration method
The matched position is the smaller absolute value of the long and short positions. For example:
if you have a long position of 1,200 and a short position of 700, the matched position is 700 (the
net open position is long 500).
 A horizontal disallowance charge:
It is a charge against correlation among the different time bands. It is allowed for correlation to
offset positions across different time bands.
There are three rounds of horizontal disallowance:
 Round 1 levies a charge on the matched position in each zone. The charge is:
o 40% for zone 1
o 30% for zone 2 and zone 3
 Round 2 levies a charge of 40% on the matched positions between adjacent zones. The
adjacent zones are:
o Zone 1 and zone 2
o Zone 2 and zone 3
 Round 3 levies a charge of 100% on the matched position between zone 1 and zone 3.
 Where applicable, a net charge for positions in options.
2. Specific Risk
Specific risk refers to changes in market prices specific to an instrument owing to factors
related to the issuer of that instrument.
Specific risk does not affect foreign exchange- and commodities-related instruments. This
is because changes in FX rates and commodities prices are dependent on general market
movements.

CBUAE Classification: Public
The charge for specific risk protects against price movements in a security owing to factors
related to the individual issuer, that is, price moves that are not initiated by the general market.
a) Offsetting
When specific risk is measured, offsetting between positions is restricted.
 Offsetting is only permitted for matched positions in an identical issue.
 Offsetting is not allowed between different issues, even if the issuer is the same. This is
because differences in coupon rates, liquidity, call features, and so on, mean that prices
may diverge in the short run.
b) Specific Risk – Capital Charge
Under the standardised approach, market risk exposures are categorised according to
external credit assessments (ratings) and based on those assessments a capital charge is
assigned. This broad methodology for calculating the specific risk capital charge was not changed
by Basel 2.5.
The capital charges assigned to those external credit assessments are similar to the credit
risk charges under the standardised approach to credit risk.
Categorisation of Securities
Consistent with other sections, a lower specific risk charge can be applied to government
paper denominated in the domestic currency and funded by the bank in the same currency. The
national discretion is limited to GCC Sovereigns. This use of national discretion aligns the Market
Risk Standards with the similar treatment under the credit risk standards. The Market Risk
Standard is also aligned to the Credit Risk Standard when it comes to the transition period
permitted for USD funded and denominated exposures of the individual Emirates.
Qualifying includes securities issued by public sector entities and multilateral development
banks, plus other securities that are rated with investment grades by two rating agencies. Unrated
securities can also be included, subject to supervisory approval (such as securities deemed to be
of comparable investment quality).
Other securities comprise of securities that do not meet the definition of government or the
definition of qualifying securities. This category receives the same risk charge as non-investment
grade borrowers under the standardised approach to credit risk. However, it is recognised that for
some high yielding debt instruments, an 8% specific risk charge may underestimate the specific
risk.
Calculating the Capital Requirement for Market and Credit Risk
The standards contain different processes for calculating the capital requirement for
market and credit risk. For credit risk, assets are first risk weighted (by multiplying them by a risk
weight) and then a capital requirement is applied. In contrast, for market risk, exposures are
simply multiplied by a specific risk capital charge. For an exposure with a given external credit
assessment (rating), the specific risk capital charge is the same as the capital requirement
calculated under the standardised approach for credit risk.

Specific Risk – Capital Charge for Positions Covered Under the Securitisation
Framework
Following the 2009 enhancements to the BCF, the specific risk of securitisation positions
held in the trading book are generally calculated in the same way as securitisation positions in the
banking book.
Specific risk – the capital charges for positions covered under the standardised approach
for securitisation exposures.
The default position for unrated securitisations can be thought of as a capital charge of
100 percent (that is, equivalent to a risk weight of 1250 percent where the capital charge is 8
percent).
Where the specific risk capital charge for an exposure is 100% such that capital is held for
the full value of the exposure, it may be excluded from the calculation of the capital charge for
general market risk. For further details, please refer to the securitisation framework.
Treatment of Interest Rate Derivatives
The interest rate risk measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and
off-balance sheet instruments assigned to the trading book that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates.
The derivatives are converted into positions in the relevant underlying. These positions
are subject to the general market risk charges and, where applicable, the specific risk charges for
interest rate risk. The amounts reported should be the market value of the principal amount of the
underlying or notional underlying.
For instruments where the apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional
amount, banks will use the effective notional amount.
Interest rate derivatives include:
 forward rate agreements (FRAs)
 other forward contracts
 bond futures
 interest rate swaps
 cross currency swaps
 forward foreign exchange positions
 interest rate options

B. Equity Risk
Market risk can be influenced by changes in equity prices, that is, equity risk.
Equity risk is the risk that movement in equity prices will have a negative effect on the
value of equity positions. The capital charge for equity risk is the sum of the charges for general
and specific market risk.
