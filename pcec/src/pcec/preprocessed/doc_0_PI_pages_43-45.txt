net receiver of collateral). The second term is non-zero only when the bank is a net poster of
collateral: it is equal to the current net posted collateral (if there is any) reduced by the un-
margined current exposure of the counterparty to the bank aggregated across all netting sets
within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the bank should include both VM and
NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is:
𝑅𝐶 =𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ max(0;𝑉 )−max (0;𝐶 ))+𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ min(0;𝑉 )−min (0;𝐶 ))
𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
where the summation NS ∈ MA is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement
(hence the notation), V is the current mark-to-market value of the netting set NS and C is the
NS MA
cash equivalent value of all currently available collateral under the margin agreement.
39. An alternative description of this calculation is as follows:
Step 1: Compute the net value, positive or negative, of each netting set. These calculated
values correspond to the terms V
NS
in the expression above.
Step 2: Sum the values of all netting sets with positive value, to get Total Positive Value
(TPV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑃𝑉 = ∑ max (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 3: Sum the values of all of netting sets with negative value, to get Total Negative
Value (TNV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑁𝑉 = ∑ min (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 4: Calculate the net current cash value of collateral, including NICA and VM. This
corresponds to the term C in the expression above. If the bank is net holder of
MA
collateral, then C is positive; it is the net value held (NVH). If the bank is a net
MA
provider of collateral, then C is negative, and its absolute value is the net value
MA
provided (NVP). Note that either NVH>0 and NVP=0, or NVP>0 and NVH=0.
One of the following cases then applies:
Step 5a: If NVH>0 (so NVP=0), then RC = TPV – NVH, but with a minimum of zero
– that is, RC cannot be negative.
or
Step 5b: If NVH=0 (so NVP>0), then RC = TPV + NVP – TNV, but with a minimum
of TPV – that is, RC cannot be less than TPV.
40. To calculate PFE when a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, netting
set level un-margined PFEs should be calculated and aggregated, i.e. PFE should be calculated
as the sum of all the individual netting sets considered as if they were not subject to any form of
margin agreement.

The following diagram provides a visual summary of the CCR calculation of EAD for derivatives,
based on replacement cost and potential future exposure.

Apply multiplier reflecting impact of any negative contract value or over-
collateralization to aggregate add-on, possibly reducing PFE by up to
95%
11. Exposure at Default (EAD) Calculation
Sum RC and PFE for the netting set, and multiply by 1.4. If the resulting
EAD for margined trades exceeds EAD if un-margined, use the un-
margined EAD.

IV. Frequently Asked Questions
A. Netting
Question A1: Does a bank need written approval for each netting agreement it has in place,
or will the Central Bank provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties?
The bank should establish an internal process that considers the factors identified in the
Standards. That process should be subject to internal review and challenge per the Standards.
The Central Bank will review the identification of netting sets as part of the supervisory process,
and notify the bank of any determinations that netting is not appropriate. The Central Bank will
not provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties.
Question A2: Do amendments to existing netting agreements require approval from the
Central Bank?
Amendments that do not raise new questions about the validity of netting need not be raised to
the Central Bank for consideration.
Question A3: What if netting is not valid? Can netting sets still be used for the calculation?
If the requirements of the Standards for recognition of netting are not satisfied, then each
transaction is its own netting set – a netting set consisting of a single transaction – and many of
the calculations are much simpler.
Question A4: Is use of the standard ISDA agreement sufficient to apply netting?
No, use of the standard ISDA agreement is not in itself sufficient to demonstrate that netting is
validand legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions under the requirements of the Standards.
Question A5: Can we treat trades with a UAE counterparty (UAE Bank or Foreign Bank
operating in the UAE) having a signed ISDA / CSA as a netting set even though the UAE is
not a netting jurisdiction?
No, as noted above, use of the standard ISDA agreement is not in itself sufficient to demonstrate
that netting is valid and legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions under the requirements of
the Standards, and is not a replacement for a determination regarding the legal enforceability of
netting.
Question A6: If there is no netting agreement of any sort in place, what would the treatment
be for trades with negative mark to market? Will they be included or excluded from the
exposure calculation?
Trades with negative value have RC=0, but still have counterparty credit risk, which will be
reflected in the calculation of the PFE component of exposure.
B. Collateral
Question B1: What haircuts should be applied to collateral for the calculations of exposure
net of collateral?
Banks should apply the standard supervisory haircuts from the capital framework.
Question B2: If a counterparty places initial cash margin against a derivatives facility, but
has no signed ISDA / CSA in place, can this cash margin be considered as collateral for
Replacement Cost calculations?
Yes, provided the arrangement allows the bank to retain the cash in the event of a default by the
counterparty.
Question B3: Can collateral received under a CSA be considered as part of the RC
calculation in absence of a netting agreement?
