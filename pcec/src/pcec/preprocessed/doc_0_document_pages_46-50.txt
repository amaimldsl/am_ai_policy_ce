instrument that underlies a single-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category. Single-
name transactions should be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the
underlying reference debt instrument of those transactions is issued by the same issuer.
34. The approach for establishing the reference entity for equity derivatives should correspond
to the general approach for credit derivatives.
35. For credit derivatives with indices as the underlying instrument, there should be one
reference entity for each group of reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives
that underlie a multi-name transaction. Multi-name transactions should be assigned to the same
credit reference entity only where the group of underlying reference debt instruments or single-
name credit derivatives of those transactions has the same constituents. The determination of
whether an index is investment grade or speculative grade should be based on the credit quality
of the majority of its individual constituents.
36. Again, the approach for equity index derivatives should follow the general approach for
credit index derivatives.
L. Special Cases of Margin Agreements
37. When multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, the netting set should be
broken down into sub-netting sets that align with the respective margin agreement for calculating
both RC and PFE.
38. When a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, RC at any given time is
determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the un-margined current exposure
of the bank to the counterparty aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement
reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. collateral is subtracted only when the bank is a
43

[Document: document.pdf, Page 46]
CBUAE Classification: Public
net receiver of collateral). The second term is non-zero only when the bank is a net poster of
collateral: it is equal to the current net posted collateral (if there is any) reduced by the un-
margined current exposure of the counterparty to the bank aggregated across all netting sets
within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the bank should include both VM and
NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is:
𝑅𝐶 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ max(0;𝑉 )−max (0;𝐶 ))+𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ min(0;𝑉 )−min (0;𝐶 ))
𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
where the summation NS ∈ MA is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement
(hence the notation), V is the current mark-to-market value of the netting set NS and C is the
NS MA
cash equivalent value of all currently available collateral under the margin agreement.
39. An alternative description of this calculation is as follows:
Step 1: Compute the net value, positive or negative, of each netting set. These calculated
values correspond to the terms V in the expression above.
NS
Step 2: Sum the values of all netting sets with positive value, to get Total Positive Value
(TPV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑃𝑉 = ∑ max (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 3: Sum the values of all of netting sets with negative value, to get Total Negative
Value (TNV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑁𝑉 = ∑ min (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 4: Calculate the net current cash value of collateral, including NICA and VM. This
corresponds to the term C in the expression above. If the bank is net holder of
MA
collateral, then C is positive; it is the net value held (NVH). If the bank is a net
MA
provider of collateral, then C is negative, and its absolute value is the net value
MA
provided (NVP). Note that either NVH>0 and NVP=0, or NVP>0 and NVH=0.
One of the following cases then applies:
Step 5a: If NVH>0 (so NVP=0), then RC = TPV – NVH, but with a minimum of zero
– that is, RC cannot be negative.
or
Step 5b: If NVH=0 (so NVP>0), then RC = TPV + NVP – TNV, but with a minimum
of TPV – that is, RC cannot be less than TPV.
40. To calculate PFE when a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, netting
set level un-margined PFEs should be calculated and aggregated, i.e. PFE should be calculated
as the sum of all the individual netting sets considered as if they were not subject to any form of
margin agreement.

IV. Frequently Asked Questions
A. Netting
Question A1: Does a bank need written approval for each netting agreement it has in place,
or will the Central Bank provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties?
The bank should establish an internal process that considers the factors identified in the
Standards. That process should be subject to internal review and challenge per the Standards.
The Central Bank will review the identification of netting sets as part of the supervisory process,
and notify the bank of any determinations that netting is not appropriate. The Central Bank will
not provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties.
Question A2: Do amendments to existing netting agreements require approval from the
Central Bank?
Amendments that do not raise new questions about the validity of netting need not be raised to
the Central Bank for consideration.
Question A3: What if netting is not valid? Can netting sets still be used for the calculation?
If the requirements of the Standards for recognition of netting are not satisfied, then each
transaction is its own netting set – a netting set consisting of a single transaction – and many of
the calculations are much simpler.
Question A4: Is use of the standard ISDA agreement sufficient to apply netting?
No, use of the standard ISDA agreement is not in itself sufficient to demonstrate that netting is
valid and legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions under the requirements of the Standards.
Question A5: Can we treat trades with a UAE counterparty (UAE Bank or Foreign Bank
operating in the UAE) having a signed ISDA / CSA as a netting set even though the UAE is
not a netting jurisdiction?
No, as noted above, use of the standard ISDA agreement is not in itself sufficient to demonstrate
that netting is valid and legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions under the requirements of
the Standards, and is not a replacement for a determination regarding the legal enforceability of
netting.
Question A6: If there is no netting agreement of any sort in place, what would the treatment
be for trades with negative mark to market? Will they be included or excluded from the
exposure calculation?
Trades with negative value have RC=0, but still have counterparty credit risk, which will be
reflected in the calculation of the PFE component of exposure.
B. Collateral
Question B1: What haircuts should be applied to collateral for the calculations of exposure
net of collateral?
Banks should apply the standard supervisory haircuts from the capital framework.
Question B2: If a counterparty places initial cash margin against a derivatives facility, but
has no signed ISDA / CSA in place, can this cash margin be considered as collateral for
Replacement Cost calculations?
Yes, provided the arrangement allows the bank to retain the cash in the event of a default by the
counterparty.
Question B3: Can collateral received under a CSA be considered as part of the RC
calculation in absence of a netting agreement?
47

[Document: document.pdf, Page 50]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Yes. Note that in the absence of netting, the netting set would consist of a single trade and any
collateral corresponding to that trade.
C. Classification of Trades
Question C1: For a currency swap involving principal and interest exchange, since there
is exchange rate risk in addition to interest rate risk, do we need to assign the notional to
both the currency and interest rate classes?
Yes, derivatives with exposure to more than one primary risk factor should be allocated to all
relevant asset classes for the PFE calculation, so this transaction should be included in its full
amount in both the Foreign Exchange hedging set and the Interest Rate hedging set.
Question C2: In a cross-currency swap with principal exchange at the beginning and at the
end, and with fixed-rate to fixed-rate interest exchange so that there is no interest rate risk,
should this trade be included only in the foreign currency category?
Yes, it should be treated as FX exposure.
Question C3: Is there any prescribed PFE treatment for a derivative such as a weather
derivative?
Derivatives with "unusual" underlying such as weather or mortality are included in the "Other"
hedging set within the Commodity asset class.
Question C4: Can trades with gold as the underlying asset be treated as currency
derivatives?
No. Although gold often has been grouped with foreign exchange historically, for the CCR
Standards it is to be treated as a metal within the commodity asset class.
D. Supervisory Delta Adjustment
Question D1: What is the Supervisory Delta for FX Swaps and FX Forwards?
These are linear contracts, so the Supervisory Delta is either +1 (for long positions) or -1 (for short
positions).
Question D2: The Standards states that the Supervisory Delta for a short position (one that
is not an option or CDO) should be -1. However, if netting is not permitted, should the
Supervisory Delta be set to +1 for all the short (as well as the long) positions?
In principle, the Supervisory Delta should be -1 if the position is short. However, in the case of a
single-trade netting set, there is no possibility of offsetting, so the sign of the Supervisory Delta
does not affect the calculation.
Question D3: In the case of an option strategy such as a straddle or strangle involving
more than one type of option (e.g. a long call and a long put), which Supervisory Delta
should be used?
In the case of positions that involve combinations of options, the position should be decomposed
into its simpler option components, appropriate Supervisory Deltas determined for each
component, and the weighted average Supervisory Delta applied to the position as a whole.
Question D4: In the case of an option strategy involving multiple options with only one leg
having a possibility of exercise, can we consider this structure as a "short" position if we
are net receiver of the premium and a "long" position if we are net payer of premium?
As noted above, in the case of positions that involve combinations of options, the position should
be decomposed into its simpler option components, appropriate Supervisory Deltas determined
for each component, and the weighted average Supervisory Delta applied to the position as a
