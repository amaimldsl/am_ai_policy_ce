VI. Equity Investments in Funds
I. Introduction
In December 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a
revised framework for calculating the capital requirements for banks’ equity investments in funds
held in the banking book. This followed a BCBS review of the risk-based capital requirements for
banks’ exposures to funds, undertaken as part of the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking. The BCBS review was undertaken
to clarify the existing treatment of such exposures in the Basel II capital adequacy framework and
to achieve a more internationally consistent and risk-sensitive capital treatment for banks’
investments in the equity of funds, reflecting both the risk of the fund’s underlying investments
and its leverage.
Following the approach developed by the BCBS in Capital requirements for banks’ equity
investments in funds, (BCBS 266, published December 2013), the Central Bank Standards for
minimum required capital for banks’ equity investments in funds relies on a hierarchy of three
successive approaches to risk weighting of fund assets, with varying degrees of risk sensitivity
and conservatism:
 The “look-through approach” (LTA): The LTA is the most granular approach. Subject to
meeting the conditions set out for its use, banks employing the LTA must apply the risk
weight of the fund’s underlying exposures as if the exposures were held directly by the
bank;
 The “mandate-based approach” (MBA): The MBA provides a degree of risk sensitivity,
and can be used when banks do not meet the conditions for applying the LTA. Banks
employing the MBA assign risk weights on the basis of the information contained in a
fund’s mandate or in relevant regulations, national legislation, or other similar rules under
which the fund is required to operate; and
 The “fall-back approach” (FBA): When neither of the above approaches is feasible, the
FBA must be used. The FBA applies a 1250 percent risk weight to a bank’s equity
investment in the fund.
To ensure that banks have appropriate incentives to enhance the risk management of their
exposures, the degree of conservatism increases with each successive approach.
The capital framework for banks’ equity investments in funds also incorporates a leverage
adjustment to the risk-weighted assets derived from the above approaches to appropriately reflect
a fund’s leverage.

II. Clarifications
A. Scope
The Standards covers banks’ equity investments held in the banking book. Note that equity
positions within the trading book are covered by the market risk capital requirements that apply
to trading book positions.
The Central Bank has chosen not to use the national discretion provided within the BCBS
framework to exclude from the standard equity positions in entities whose debt obligations qualify
for a zero risk weight. The Central Bank also has chosen not to use the national discretion
provided within the BCBS framework to exclude from the scope of the standard equity investments
made under identified official programs that support specified sectors of the economy
B. General Design of the Capital Requirement
At a high level, the framework is designed such that the risk-weight for a bank’s equity
investment in a fund depends on the average risk weight that would be applicable to the assets
of the fund, and on the extent of use of leverage by the fund. The approach to the average risk
weight for any fund will reflect one or more of the three approaches described briefly above (and
described more fully in the Standards).
The illustration below gives a general overview of how the average risk weight and
leverage are combined, subject to a cap of 1250%, and then applied to the bank’s equity
investment in the funds.
For example, if the average risk weight of the assets held by the fund is 80%, and the fund
is financed through half debt and half equity, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 2.0 and
the risk weight applied to a bank’s investment in the fund would be:
80% x 2.0 = 160%
If instead the same fund is financed 90% by debt, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 10,
and the risk weight applied to the bank’s investment in the fund would be 800% (80% x 10).
Another way to view the capital requirement for equity investments in funds is that a bank
generally must count a proportional amount of the risk-weighted assets (RWA) of the fund as the
bank’s own RWA for capital purposes, in proportion to the bank’s share of the equity of the fund.
Ignoring the 1250% limit for simplicity, the RWA calculation can bewritten as:
𝑅𝑊𝐴 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑅𝑊𝐴 =( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘′𝑠 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑

𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑
=𝑅𝑊𝐴 ×𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘′𝑠 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑
The rearrangement of the terms in the equation highlights that the bank’s RWA from the EIF is
the bank’s proportional share of the fund’s RWA – if the bank holds a 5% share of the equity in
the fund, then the bank’s RWA is 5% of the total RWA of the fund. This isa logical treatment – if
a bank effectively owns 5% of a fund, the bank must hold capital as if it owns 5% of the fund’s
risk-weighted assets.
C. Look-Through Approach
The LTA requires a bank to assign the same risk weights to the underlying exposures of
a fund as would be assigned if the bank held the exposures directly. The information used for to
determine the risk weights must meet the requirements stated in the Standards, including
sufficiency, frequency, and third party review. However, that information is not required to be
derived from sources that are subject to an external audit.
RWA and assets of investment funds should, to the extent possible, be evaluated using
the same accounting standards the bank would apply if the assets were held directly. However,
where this is not possible due to constraints on available information, the evaluation can be based
on the accounting standards applied by the investment fund, provided the treatment of the
numerator (RWA) and the denominator (total unweighted assets) is consistent.
If a bank relies on third-party calculations for determining the underlying risk weights of
the exposures of the fund, the risk weights should be increased by a factor of 1.2 times to
compensate for the fact that the bank cannot be certain about the accuracy of third-party
information. For instance, any exposure that is ordinarily subject to a 20% risk weight under the
risk-based capital standards would be weighted at 24% (1.2×20%) when the look-through is
performed by a third party.
D. Mandate-Based Approach
Under the MBA, banks may use the information contained in a fund’s mandate, or in the
rules or regulations governing such investment funds in the relevant jurisdiction. Information used
for this purpose is not strictly limited to a fund’s mandate or to national regulations or other
requirements that govern such funds. For example, a bank could obtain information from the
fund’s prospectus or from other disclosures of the fund.
To ensure that all underlying risks are taken into account (including CCR) and that the
MBA renders capital requirements no less than the LTA, the Standards requires that risk-weighted
assets for funds’ exposures be calculated as the sum of three items:
 On-balance-sheet exposures;
 Off-balance-sheet exposures including notional value of derivatives exposures; and
 CCR exposure for derivatives.

As with the LTA, for purposes of the MBA the RWA and assets of investment funds should,
to the extent possible, be evaluated using the same accounting standards the bank would apply
if the assets were held directly. However, where this is not possible due to constraints on available
information, the evaluation can be based on the accounting standards applied by the investment
fund, provided the treatment of the numerator (RWA) and the denominator (total unweighted
assets) is consistent.
In general, the MBA aims to take a conservative approach by calculating the highest risk-
weighted assets the fund could achieve under the terms of its mandate or governing laws and
regulations. Under the MBA, the bank should assume that the fund’s assets are first invested to
the maximum extent allowable in assets that would attract the highest risk weight, and then to the
maximum extent allowable in the next riskiest type of asset, and so on until all of the fund’s
balance sheet assets have been assigned to a risk-weight category. If more than one risk weight
could be applied to a given exposure, the bank must use the maximum applicable risk weight. For
example, if the mandate does not place restrictions on the rating quality of the fund’s investments
in corporate bonds, the bank should apply a risk weight of 150% to the fund’s corporate bond
positions.
For derivatives, when the replacement cost is unknown, the Standards takes a
conservative approach by setting replacement cost equal to the notional amount of the derivatives
contracts. When the notional amount of a fund’s derivative exposure is unknown, the approach
again is conservative: the bank should use the maximum notional amount of derivatives allowed
under the fund’s mandate. When the PFE for derivatives is unknown, the PFE add-on should be
set at 15% of the notional value. Thus, if the replacement costand PFE add-on both are unknown,
a total multiplication factor of 1.15 must be applied to the notional amount to reflect the CCR
exposure.
Instead of determining a CVA charge associated with the fund’s derivative exposures, the
Standards allows banks to multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk
weight associated with the counterparty. However, a bank is not required to apply the 1.5 factor
for situations in which the CVA capital charge would not otherwise be applicable. Notably, this
includes derivative transactions for which the direct counterparty is a qualifying central
counterparty.
E. Leverage Adjustment
A leverage adjustment is applied to the average risk weight of the fund under either the
LTA or the MBA. A similar leverage adjustment is not necessary for the FBA, because the risk
weight of 1250% applied under the FBA to equity investments in funds is fixed at that maximum
value.
When determining the leverage adjustment under the MBA, banks are required to make
conservative assumptions using information from the fund’s mandate. Specifically, the Standards
requires that banks assume the fund will use financial leverage up to the maximum amount
permitted under the fund’s mandate, or up to the maximum permitted under the regulations
governing that fund. This maximum may be significantly greater than the actual leverage for the
fund at any point in time.

III. Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: BCBS 266 states “Equity holdings in entities whose debt obligations qualify
for a zero risk weight can be excluded from the LTA, MBA and FBA approaches (including
those publicly sponsored entities where a zero risk weight can be applied), at the
discretion of the national supervisor.” Are such equity holdings excluded under the
Central Bank’s Standards?
No, the Central Bank of the UAE has chosen not to adopt this point of national discretion. Bank
investments in such funds are subject to the requirements of the Standards.
Question 2: If a bank makes a “seed capital investment” in a fund that is out of scope of
consolidation, and is considered a significant investment in the common shares of a
banking,financial,orinsuranceentity,isitwithinscopeasanequityinvestmentinafund?
If the investment is one that the bank would be required to deduct from capital, then the investment
is not in scope for this Standards.
Question 3: If a bank makes a “seed capital investment” in a fund, and that fund is managed
by a Fund Manager hired by the bank, is the investment considered to be a direct investment
in the fund, or indirect?
Assuming that the fund in question is not consolidated into the bank under accounting rules for
financial reporting, such an investment is considered a direct investment under the Standards.
Question 4: Under the Standards, what methodology should a bank use to compute
counterparty credit risk exposure for funds in which the bank has an equity investment?
The Standards states that banks must risk weight all exposures as if the bank held those
exposures directly. Thus, the risk weights and the exposure amounts for counterparty credit risk
should be determined using the standards that would apply to the bank. For banks in the UAE,
the applicable standards for counterparty credit risk is the Central Bank’s Standards for
Counterparty Credit Risk Capital, which reflects the Standardised Approach to Counterparty
Credit Risk (SA-CCR).
Question 5: If a bank relies on a third-party information provider for information used to
calculate the leverage adjustment for a fund, does the 1.2 multiplication factor apply?
No, as the Standards states, the factor of 1.2 applies when the bank relies on a third party for the
risk weights of the underlying exposures. This is a conservative adjustment to recognize the
uncertainty associated with such information about risk weights. It does not apply to the leverage
ratio calculation.
Question 6: The FBA applies a risk weight of 1250%, which is significantly higher than the
