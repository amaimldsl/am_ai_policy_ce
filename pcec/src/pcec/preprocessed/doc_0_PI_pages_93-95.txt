the key elements underlying the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective basis
and free of charge. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a
transaction do not satisfy this requirement. Where the eligible credit assessment is not publicly
available free of charge, the ECAI should provide an adequate justification, within its own publicly
available code of conduct, in accordance with the “comply or explain” nature of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions’ Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating
Agencies.
Under the Standards, a bank may infer a rating for an unrated position from an externally
rated “reference exposure” for purposes of the SEC-ERBA provided that the reference
securitisation exposure ranks pari passu or is subordinate in all respects to the unrated
securitisation exposure. Credit enhancements, if any, must be taken into account when assessing
the relative subordination of the unrated exposure and the reference securitisation exposure. For
example, if the reference securitisationexposure benefits from any third-party guarantees or other
credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated exposure, then the latter may not be
assigned an inferred rating based on the reference securitisation exposure.
4. Standardised Approach (SEC-SA)
The supervisory formula used for the calculations within the SEC-SA has been calibrated
by the BCBS to generate required capital under an assumed minimum 8% risk-based capital ratio.
As a result, the appropriate conversion to risk-weighted assets for the SEC-SA generally requires
multiplication of the computed capital ratio by a factor of 12.5 (the reciprocal of 8%) to produce
the risk weight used within broader calculations of risk-based capital adequacy. This multiplication
by 12.5 is reflected in the requirements as articulated in the Central Bank’s Securitisation
Standards.
If the underlying pool of exposures receives a risk weight of 1250%, then paragraph 5 of
the Introduction of the Standards for Capital Adequacy of banks in the UAE is applicable.
When applying the supervisory formula for the SEC-SA to structures involving an SPE, all
of the SPE’s exposures related to the securitisation are to be treated as exposures in the pool. In
particular, in the case of swaps other than credit derivatives, the exposure should include the
positive current market value times the risk weight of the swap provider. However, under the
Standards, a bank can exclude the exposures of the SPE from the pool for capital calculation
purposes if the bank can demonstrate that the risk does not affect its particular securitisation
exposure or that the risk is immaterial, for example because it has been mitigated. Certain market
practices may eliminate or at least significantly reduce the potential risk from a default of a swap
provider. Examples of such features could be:
 cash collateralization of the market value in combination with an agreement of prompt
additional payments in case of an increase of the market value of the swap; or
 minimum credit quality of the swap provider with the obligation to post collateral or present
an alternative swap provider without any costs for the SPE in the event of a credit
deterioration on the part of the original swap provider.

If the bank is able to demonstrate that the risk is mitigated in this way, and that the exposures do
not contribute materially to the risks faced by the bank as a holder of the securitisation exposure,
the bank may exclude these exposures from the K
SA
calculation.
6. Treatment of credit risk mitigation for securitisation exposures
1. Tranched protection
In the case of tranched credit protection, the original securitisation tranche should be
decomposed into protected and unprotected sub-tranches. However, this decomposition is a
theoretical construction, and should not be viewed as creating a new securitisation transaction.
Similarly, the resulting sub- tranches should not be considered resecuritisations solely due to the
presence of the creditprotection.
For a bank using the SEC-ERBA for the original securitisation exposure, the bank should
use the risk weight of the original securitisation for the sub-tranche of highest priority. Note that
the term “sub-tranche of highest priority” only describes the relative priority of the decomposed
tranche. The calculation of the risk weight of each sub-tranche is independent from the question
of whether the sub-tranche is protected (i.e., risk is taken by the protection provider) or is
unprotected (i.e., risk is taken by the protection buyer).
2. Maturity mismatches
For synthetic securitisations, maturity mismatches may arise when protection is bought on
securitised assets (when, for example, a bank uses credit derivatives to transfer part or all of the
credit risk of a specific pool of assets to third parties). When the credit derivatives unwind, the
transaction will terminate. This implies that the effective maturity of all the tranches of the synthetic
securitisation may differ from that of the underlying exposures.
7. Simple, Transparent, and Comparable Criteria
In general, to qualify for treatment as simple, transparent, and comparable (STC), a
securitisation must meet all of the criteria specified in the Standards, including the Appendix to
the Standards. The criteria include a requirement that the aggregated value of all exposures to a
single obligor as of the acquisition date not exceed 2% of the aggregated outstanding exposure
value of all exposures in the securitisation. However, the BCBS has permitted flexibility for
jurisdictions with structurally concentrated corporate loan markets. In those cases, for corporate
exposures only, the applicable maximum concentration threshold for STC treatment can be
increased to 3%. This increase is subject to ex ante supervisory approval, and banks with such
exposures should consult with the Central Bank regarding STC treatment. In addition, the seller
or sponsor of such a pool must retain subordinated positions that provide loss-absorbing credit
enhancement covering at least the first 10% of losses. These credit-enhancing positions retained
by the sellers or sponsor are not eligible for STC capital treatment.

III. Example Calculations
A. Standardised Approach
Consider a bank applying the SEC-SA to a securitisation exposure for which the
underlying pool of assets has a required capital ratio of 9% under the standardised approach to
credit risk. Suppose that the delinquency rate is unknown for 1% of the exposures in the
underlying pool, but for the remaining 99% of the pool the delinquency rate is known to be 6%.
The bank holds an investment of 100 million in a tranche that has an attachment point of 5% and
a detachment point of 25%. Finally, assume that the pool does not itself contain any securitisation
exposures, so the exposure is not a resecuritisation.
In this example, K is given at 9%. To adjust for the known delinquency rate on the pooled
SA
assets, the bank computes an adjusted capital ratio:
(1−𝑊)×𝐾 +(𝑊×0.5)=0.94×0.09+0.06×0.5=0.1146
𝑆𝐴
This calculated capital ratio must be further adjusted for the fact that the delinquency rate
is unknown for a small portion (1%) of the underlying asset pool:
𝐾 =0.99×0.1146+0.01=0.1235
𝐴
Next, the bank applies the supervisory formula to calculate the capital required per unit of
securitisation exposure, using the values of the attachment point A, the detachment point D, the
calculated value of K , and the appropriate value of the supervisory parameter ρ, and noting that
A
D>K :
A
𝑒𝑎×𝑈−𝑒𝑎×𝐿
𝐾 =
𝑎×(𝑈−𝐿)
Where:

a= = =−8.100
ρ×K 1×0.1234
A
U=D−K =0.25−0.1235=0.1265
A
L=max[(A−K ),0] =max[(0.05−0.1235),0]=0
A
Note that because this is not a resecuritisation exposure, the appropriate value of the supervisory
calibration parameter rho is 1 (ρ=1).
Substituting the values of a, U, and L into the supervisory formula gives:
e−8.1×0.1265−e−8.1×0 0.3586−1
𝐾 = = =0.6260
−8.1×(0.1265−0) −8.1×0.1265
This tranche represents a case in which the attachment point A is less than K but the
A
detachment point D is greater than K . Thus, according to the Standards, the risk weight for the
A
bank’s exposure is calculated as a weighted average of 12.5 and 12.5×K:

=( )×12.5+( )×12.5×0.6260=9.54,or 954%
0.2 0.2
With a tranche risk weight of 954%, the bank’s risk-weighted asset amount for this
securitisation would be 954% of the 100 million investment, or 954 million. If, for example, the
bank chose to apply a capital ratio of 13% to this exposure, then the bank’s required capital would
be 13% of 954 million, or approximately 85 million, on the investment of 100 million in this
securitisation tranche.
B. External Ratings-Based Approach
Consider a non-senior securitisation tranche that has been assigned a rating by one of the
eligible rating agencies corresponding to a rating of BB+. Suppose that the tranche has an
attachment point A of 5%, a detachment point D of 30%, and effective tranche maturity of M = 2
T
years.
 From the look-up table for SEC-ERBA, a non-senior securitisation exposure rated BB+
with one-year maturity has a risk weight of 470%; the risk weight for a five-year maturity
is 580%.
 The tranche maturity of 2 years is one-quarter of the way between one year and five years,
so the relevant maturity-adjusted risk weight based on linear interpolation is one quarter
of the way between 470% and 580%, or 497.5%.
 Because this is a non-senior tranche, it must also be adjusted for tranche thickness, which
is the difference between D=30% and A=5%, a difference of 25%. The interpolated risk
weight from the table should be multiplied by a factor of 1-(D-A)=0.75, which exceeds the
floor of 50% and therefore should be used by the bank in the calculation (0.75 x 497.5%).
 The resulting tranche risk weight is 373%.
Banks using the SEC-ERBA for securitisation exposures may prefer to incorporate the
main features of the ERBA look-up tables into formal calculations of risk weights, including the
relevant adjustments for tranche maturity and tranche thickness. In that case, each pair of 1-year
and 5-year risk weights can be viewed as coefficients for a formulaic calculation of the risk weight
for a tranche of given maturity M T, and in the case of non-senior tranches, thickness D-A.
For example, for a non-senior tranche rated BB+ with M between one year and five years,
T
the tranche risk weight RW
T
can be computed with a single formula as:
𝑀 −1
𝑇
𝑅𝑊 =𝑚𝑎𝑥 [0.5 ,1−(𝐷−𝐴)]×(4.7+( )×(5.8−4.7))
𝑇 4
where the coefficients 4.7 and 5.8 correspond to the relevant values from the look-up table of
470% for one-year maturity and 580% for five-year maturity. Substituting in the values for A, D,
and M from the example above:
T
2−1
𝑅𝑊 =𝑚𝑎𝑥[0.5 ,1−(30%−5%)]×(4.7+( )×(1.1))=0.75×4.975=3.73,or 373%
