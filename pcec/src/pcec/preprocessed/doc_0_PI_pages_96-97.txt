III. Example Calculations
A. Standardised Approach
Consider a bank applying the SEC-SA to a securitisation exposure for which the
underlying pool of assets has a required capital ratio of 9% under the standardised approach to
credit risk. Suppose that the delinquency rate is unknown for 1% of the exposures in the
underlying pool, but for the remaining 99% of the pool the delinquency rate is known to be 6%.
The bank holds an investment of 100 million in a tranche that has an attachment point of 5% and
a detachment point of 25%. Finally, assume that the pool does not itself contain any securitisation
exposures, so the exposure is not a resecuritisation.
In this example, K is given at 9%. To adjust for the known delinquency rate on the pooled
SA
assets, the bank computes an adjusted capital ratio:
(1−𝑊)×𝐾 +(𝑊×0.5)=0.94×0.09+0.06×0.5=0.1146
𝑆𝐴
This calculated capital ratio must be further adjusted for the fact that the delinquency rate
is unknown for a small portion (1%) of the underlying asset pool:
𝐾 =0.99×0.1146+0.01=0.1235
𝐴
Next, the bank applies the supervisory formula to calculate the capital required per unit of
securitisation exposure, using the values of the attachment point A, the detachment point D, the
calculated value of K , and the appropriate value of the supervisory parameter ρ, and noting that
A
D>K :

𝑒𝑎×𝑈−𝑒𝑎×𝐿
𝐾 =
𝑎×(𝑈−𝐿)
Where:

ρ×K 1×0.1234
A
U=D−K =0.25−0.1235=0.1265
A
L=max[(A−K ),0] =max[(0.05−0.1235),0]=0
A
Note that because this is not a resecuritisation exposure, the appropriate value of the supervisory
calibration parameter rho is 1 (ρ=1).
Substituting the values of a, U, and L into the supervisory formula gives:
e−8.1×0.1265−e−8.1×0 0.3586−1
𝐾 = = =0.6260
−8.1×(0.1265−0) −8.1×0.1265
This tranche represents a case in which the attachment point A is less than K but the
A
detachment point D is greater than K . Thus, according to the Standards, the risk weight for the
A
bank’s exposure is calculated as a weighted average of 12.5 and 12.5×K:

0.2 0.2
With a tranche risk weight of 954%, the bank’s risk-weighted asset amount for this
securitisation would be 954% of the 100 million investment, or 954 million. If, for example, the
bank chose to apply a capital ratio of 13% to this exposure, then the bank’s required capital would
be 13% of 954 million, or approximately 85 million, on the investment of 100 million in this
securitisation tranche.
B. External Ratings-Based Approach
Consider a non-senior securitisation tranche that has been assigned a rating by one of the
eligible rating agencies corresponding to a rating of BB+. Suppose that the tranche has an
attachment point A of 5%, a detachment point D of 30%, and effective tranche maturity of M = 2
T
years.
 From the look-up table for SEC-ERBA, a non-senior securitisation exposure rated BB+
with one-year maturity has a risk weight of 470%; the risk weight for a five-year maturity
is 580%.
 The tranche maturity of 2 years is one-quarter of the way between one year and five years,
so the relevant maturity-adjusted risk weight based on linear interpolation is one quarter
of the way between 470% and 580%, or 497.5%.
 Because this is a non-senior tranche, it must also be adjusted for tranche thickness, which
is the difference between D=30% and A=5%, a difference of 25%. The interpolated risk
weight from the table should be multiplied by a factor of 1-(D-A)=0.75, which exceeds the
floor of 50% and therefore should be used by the bank in the calculation (0.75 x 497.5%).
 The resulting tranche risk weight is 373%.
Banks using the SEC-ERBA for securitisation exposures may prefer to incorporate the
main features of the ERBA look-up tables into formal calculations of risk weights, including the
relevant adjustments for tranche maturity and tranche thickness. In that case, each pair of 1-year
and 5-year risk weights can be viewed as coefficients for a formulaic calculation of the risk weight
for a tranche of given maturity M T, and in the case of non-senior tranches, thickness D-A.
For example, for a non-senior tranche rated BB+ with M between one year and five years,
T
the tranche risk weight RW
T
can be computed with a single formula as:
𝑀 −1
𝑇
𝑅𝑊 =𝑚𝑎𝑥 [0.5 ,1−(𝐷−𝐴)]×(4.7+( )×(5.8−4.7))
𝑇 4
where the coefficients 4.7 and 5.8 correspond to the relevant values from the look-up table of
470% for one-year maturity and 580% for five-year maturity. Substituting in the values for A, D,
and M from the example above:
T
2−1
𝑅𝑊 =𝑚𝑎𝑥[0.5 ,1−(30%−5%)]×(4.7+( )×(1.1))=0.75×4.975=3.73,or 373%
𝑇 4

Senior tranches are not adjusted for thickness; hence, the calculation of the tranche risk
weight RW
T
for a senior BB+ rated tranche would be computed as:
𝑀 −1
𝑇
𝑅𝑊 =1.4+( )×(1.6−1.4)=1.4+0.25×0.2=1.45,or 145%
𝑇 4
where again the coefficients 1.4 and 1.6 correspond to the relevant values from the senior tranche
columns of the look-up table, specifically 140% for 1-year maturity and 160% for 5-year maturity.

VIII. Market Risk
I. Introduction and scope
This section supports the Market risk standards in clarifying the calculation of the market
risk capital requirement.
The capital charges for interest rate related instruments and equities will apply to the
trading book. The capital charges for foreign exchange risk and for commodities risk will apply to
banks’ total currency and commodity positions (i.e. entire book).
Capital requirements for market risk apply on a consolidated basis. Note that the capital
required for general and specific market risk under these Standards is in addition to, not in place
of, any capital required under other Central Bank Standards. Banks should follow the
requirements of all other applicable Central Bank standards to determine overall capital adequacy
requirements.
II. Identifying Market Risk Drivers
For a particular instrument, the risk drivers that influence the market prices of that
instrument must be identified. In a portfolio, the correlations between instruments also influence
the risk profile of the entire portfolio (i.e. Banking and Trading book).
The market price of an asset incorporates virtually all known information concerning that
asset. In practice; however, it is very difficult to clearly separate the main sources that influence
an instrument's market price and risk level.
As a simplification, the following are generally recognised as the main market risk drivers:
A. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the potential for losses in on- or off-balance sheet positions from
adverse changes in interest rates. Instruments covered by the standardised approach for interest
rate risk include all fixed rate and floating rate related instruments, such as debt securities, swaps,
forwards and futures.
The standardised approach provides a framework for measuring interest rate risk. It takes
into account the maturity or duration of the positions, basis risk, and certain correlations among
risk factors.
Duration is a measure ofthe average maturity of a debt instrument's cash flows from both
coupons and principal repayment. It is expressed in years and allows debt instruments with
different coupons andmaturities to be compared. Based on the duration, the sensitivity of a fixed
income security's price with respect to a small change in its yield can be determined.
When hedging positions, basis risk is a key risk for the hedged position and needs to be
