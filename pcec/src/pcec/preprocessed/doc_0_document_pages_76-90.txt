This form, which separates the factor of 0.5 from the rest of the systematic portion before it is
raised to the second power, highlights the fact that the CVA calculation can be viewed as
effectively a weighted average of two components, a systematic component with a weight of 25%,
and an idiosyncratic component with a weight of 75%. The 25% weight on the idiosyncratic
component is the theoretically correct weight if counterparties have a common systematic
correlation with the broader market of 50%. Note that this form is simply a mathematical
restatement of the capital calculation, yielding an identical answer for the stated case (that is,
single-name hedging only, no index hedges).
The portfolio-level calculation of CVA risk also recognizes that index hedges may reduce
systematic CVA risk. The calculation including index hedges is:

where Hind is the notional of an eligible purchased index hedge instrument that is used to hedge CVA risk,
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑑)
𝐷𝐹 = is the applicable supervisory discount factor, and M is the maturity of the index hedge.
𝑖𝑛𝑑 ind
0.05
Note that the effect of the index hedge appears only in the systematic component of CVA risk within the
square root. Also, note that there is no correlation-related coefficient associated with the index hedges,
analogous to the 0.5 or 0.75 coefficients for the single-name exposure terms. This reflects the fact that an
index CDS closely tracks the market, with a correlation expected to be near perfect. The correct coefficient
on the index hedge terms in the model would be approximately 1.0, which is the reason for their omission.
The Standards also includes a version of the formula that more closely resembles the full
formula used in the BCBS framework:

In this form, the intermediate calculation of SNE is not used. However, the results of the
calculation are exactly the same as those produced by the formulation using SNE.
F. Maturity Calculation
When computing the maturity M for a netting set, banks are required to use a weighted
average, with notional values as the weights. For example, suppose a netting set with a particular
counterparty includes two exposures, a 2-year swap with a notional amount of 200, and a 3-year
swap with a notional amount of 400. The total notional value of the netting set is therefore
200+400=600. The weighted average maturity would be calculated as:
200 400
𝑀 = 2×( )+3×( )= 2.67
600 600

G. Risk Weights
Derivatives exposures and CVA hedges enter the CVA capital calculation with associated
risk weights that depend on the credit rating of the bank’s counterparties for the covered
exposures, or on the credit rating of the underlying entity for hedge instruments. In the case of
unrated counterparties or entities, banks should follow the approach applied by the Central Bank
for credit derivatives that reference unrated entities in the CCR Standards, treating them as BBB
rated unless the counterparty or entity has an elevated risk of default, in which case they should
be treated as BB rated.
The CVA Standards follows the BCBS framework in specifying an array of risk weights
that align with an external rating scale that is most similar to the one used by Standard and Poor’s.
Use of this rating scale for purposes of the CVA Standards should not be viewed as an
endorsement of that or any other external rating agency. Banks may use other ratings, and should
map those ratings to the scale included in the Standards using the historical default experience
for the various rating grades as published by the relevant external rating agencies.
H. Risk-Weighted Assets
The formula developed by the BCBS to determine CVA capital reflects a calibration based
on the 8% minimum capital ratio applied in the Basel capital framework. To calculate a
corresponding RWA amount, the Standards requires banks to multiply the calculated CVA capital
by a factor of 12.5, which is the reciprocal of 8%. That is, 1/(0.08) = 12.5. This multiplication is
appropriate even if the Central Bank applies a higher minimum capital requirement to the resulting
RWA, because the purpose of the multiplication by 12.5 is to reverse the calibration implicitly used
by the BCBS to produce a capital number in the original formulation.
I. Threshold for the Simple Alternative
As part of the finalization of Basel III, the BCBS introduced a materiality threshold, and
provided an option for any bank whose aggregate notional amount of non-centrally cleared
derivatives is less than or equal to 100 billion euro to choose to set its CVA capital equal to 100%
of its capital for counterparty credit risk.
To implement this option in the UAE, the Central Bank has established a materiality
threshold of 400 billion AED. Banks with an aggregate notional amount of covered transactions
less than or equal to 400 billion AED may choose to set CVA RWA equal to the bank’s RWA for
counterparty credit risk as calculated under the Central Bank’s CCR Standards. The Central Bank
has determined that this threshold is appropriate for the UAE, and is comparable to the 100 Billion
Euro threshold included in Basel.
If a bank chooses this CDS, it must be applied to all of the bank’s covered transactions,
as required under the BCBS framework. In addition, a bank adopting this simple approach may
not recognize the risk-reducing effects of CVA hedges.
The Central Bank may prohibit a bank from using this simple alternative if the Central bank
determines that CVA risk resulting from the bank’s derivative positions and SFTs materially
contributes to the bank’s overall risk, and therefore warrants a more sophisticated approach.

III. Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: Are all transactions with Central Counterparties excluded from the CVA capital
calculation?
No, only transactions for which the direct counterparty is a qualifying CCP (QCCP) are excluded.
Note that under the CCR Standard, the bank must have a determination of non-objection from the
Central Bank with regard to any specific QCCP.
Question 2: Should debit valuation adjustment (DVA) be netted from CVA for the capital
calculation?
No, DVA cannot be taken into account to reduce regulatory CVA for the capital calculation.
Question 3: What types of transactions can qualify as CVA hedges?
A CVA hedge can be any financial instrument or contract that refers specifically to the
counterparty by name, and whose value increases when the credit quality of the counterparty
being hedged deteriorates. However, the Standards does not permit "nth-to-default" credit
derivatives (index or basket credit derivatives in which payment is made only on the event of the
“nth” default by a reference entity in the basket, rather than the first default) to be used as CVA
hedges.
Question 4: If a CDS serves as an eligible CVA hedge for one counterparty, does it also
create counterparty exposure to the counterparty for the CDS?
Yes, a CDS or other hedging instrument used for CVA hedging also can create counterparty
exposure, and in that case requires capital to cover the associated risks presented by that
counterparty, including CVA. For example, if a bank has CVA exposure to counterparty A, and
hedges that exposure by purchasing a credit default swap from counterparty B, the CVA charge
for exposure to counterparty A may be reduced, but the bank now likely is exposed to CVA risk
on counterparty B.
Question 5: For calculating the weighted average maturity, should we use the original deal
notional values, or the effective notional values per the CCR standards?
Either approach is acceptable, provided the bank is consistent in its selected approach.
Question 6: If there is no valid netting set with a counterparty, how should average maturity
be calculated?
Average maturity is calculated at the netting set level, for each netting set with each counterparty.
If netting is not valid, then the “netting set” consists of a single transaction, which will have its own
maturity per the contractual terms of the transaction. Without valid netting, there may be as many
“netting sets” for a counterparty as there are derivative transactions with that counterparty.
Question 7: To compute weighted average maturity, we have conservatively treated each
trade as a stand-alone netting set. Is this conservative treatment acceptable?
Yes, this treatment is acceptable.
Question 8: When calculating average maturity for a netting set, should we consider each
asset class separately?
Maturity calculations for CVA must be calculated for each netting set, reflecting all covered
transactions within a given netting set, regardless of asset class.
Question 9: If an entity has ratings from multiple rating agencies, which one should be
76

[Document: document.pdf, Page 79]
CBUAE Classification: Public
used to determine the risk weight for CVA capital?
If there are ratings from two different rating agencies that map to different risk weights, the higher
risk weight should be applied. If there are ratings from three or more rating agencies that map to
different risk weights, the two ratings that correspond to the lowest risk weights should be referred
to. If these two ratings give rise to the same risk weight, that risk weight should be applied. If the
two are different, the higher of the two risk weights should be applied.
Question 10: If a counterparty is within a legal organizational structure that includes
multiple entities with different ratings, which rating should be used for the CVA capital
calculation?
The bank should use the rating for the entity that is actually obligated as a counterparty to the
bank under the terms of the transactions within the applicable netting set.
Question 11: Is there any special CVA treatment for counterparties that have a zero risk
weight for credit risk under the risk-based capital standards?
No, they are treated like all other counterparties (other than CCPs). Note that CVA risk is different
from the more general type of credit risk treated under the risk-based standards. The risk weights
in the CVA standards are intended to reflect credit spread risk, and generally differ from the risk
weights used for other capital requirements. For all counterparties, apply the CVA risk weight that
corresponds to the rating of the entity, or if unrated, apply the approach specified for unrated
counterparties.
Question 12: We prefer to map unrated counterparties to CCC as a conservative treatment;
is that acceptable, or must they be mapped to BBB?
The bank is free to apply a more conservative treatment to unrated counterparties, and should do
so if it considers the more conservative treatment to be appropriate. However, the bank should
be consistent in its approach, and should not apply this process in a way that might reduce
exposure for the CVA calculation relative to the treatment stated in the standards.
Question 13: Should all SFT exposures be considered in scope for the CVA calculation, or
only those that create gross SFT assets per the leverage ratio exposure measure? Will SFT
exposures be classified separately for the computation of Credit RWAs in CAR
computation?
All SFTs should be reflected in the CVA calculation, whether or not they create non-zero gross
SFT asset values for the leverage ratio.
Credit risk capital for SFT exposures is addressed as part of the general credit risk standards for
risk-based capital adequacy requirements.
Question 14: When determining exposure for SFTs, are haircuts to be applied to the fair
value of the securities?
No, haircuts should not be applied – use the fair value without haircuts.
Question 15: Can the weighted average maturity for SFT exposures be based on the
exposure amounts?
Yes, that approach is acceptable, provided it is applied consistently.
Question 16: Can we consider Global Master Repo Agreements signed with banks in the
UAE as qualifying master netting agreements (MNA) for SFT exposure computation?
Banks should apply the requirements for valid netting agreements as stated in the Central Bank’s
Standards for Counterparty Credit Risk to determine whether netting is valid in any particular
case, rather than using broad categorical criteria.

CBUAE Classification: Public
Question 17: Will the Central Bank establish a specific quantitative materiality threshold
to determine whether SFTs are in scope for CVA capital?
The Central Bank does not intend to establish a specific threshold, but instead will determine the
materiality of CVA risk from SFTs on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant factors
that may affect the CVA risk posed by SFTs at each bank.
Question 18: The CVA guidelines require computation of single-name exposure (SNE),
while the CCR Standards is based on hedging sets; different names may be included in
the same hedging set. Does this create an inconsistency?
It does not. Note that the single “name” for CVA capital is the derivatives or SFT counterparty. It
does not depend on any underlying reference names for credit derivatives or other transactions
with a given counterparty. Suppose for example that a bank has two credit derivatives that depend
on the performance of Company A and Company B (that is, those are the underlying reference
names for the credit derivatives), and that the bank’s counterparty for both credit derivatives is
another bank, Bank C. Under the CCR standards, assuming that the netting requirements are
met, the two credit derivatives would be in a single hedging set within a netting set with Bank C.
For calculation of CVA capital, the SNE would reflect the bank’s CCR exposure to the single
“name” that is Bank C; neither the names nor the ratings of Company A or Company B enter the
CVA calculation directly. The CVA risk-weight for the bank’s CVA capital calculation would depend
on the credit rating of Bank C, not the ratings of either Company A or Company B.
Question 19: Should we multiply the sum of replacement cost and potential future
exposure by the same 1.4 scaling factor used in the SA-CCR standards issued by Central
Bank?
Yes, that is correct; the same multiplicative scaling factor of 1.4 should be used for the CVA
calculation as well.
Question 20: Can banks used the Basic Approach for CVA (BA-CVA) recently published by
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2017?
Not at this time. The Central Bank may consider the BA-CVA at a later date.
Question 21: Bank ask in case of calculating discounted counterparty exposure is a double
count and will inflate CVA Capital charge given SA-CCR EAD already factors in maturity
adjustment while computing adjusted notional which is product of trade notional &
supervisory duration?
The use of the discount factor in the CVA capital charge does not result in double counting. While
there is superficial similarity between the supervisory duration (SD) adjustment in SA-CCR and
the discount factor (DF) in CVA, they are actually capturing different aspects of risk exposure.
The use of SD in SA-CCR adjusts the notional amount of the derivatives to reflect its sensitivity
to changes in interest rates, since longer-term derivatives are more sensitive to rate changes than
are shorter-term derivatives. In contrast, the use of DF in the CVA calculation reflects the fact that
a bank is exposed to CVA risk not only during the first year of a derivative contract, but over the
life of the contract; the DF term recognizes the present value of the exposure over the life of the
contract. Thus, these two factors, although they have similar functional forms and therefore
appear somewhat similar, are not in fact duplicative.
Question 22: Further elaboration on "equivalent hedging instrument that directly
references the counterparty being hedged"?
This could be any instrument or contract that refers specifically to the counterparty by name, and
whose value increases when the credit quality of the counterparty being hedged deteriorates.
However, it does not include "nth-to-default" credit derivatives.
Question 23: What if a Bank hold a CVA liability in our books, charged to P&L, once we

CBUAE Classification: Public
have the additional capital requirement on CVA, will this liability be netted off against the
CVA capital requirement, or an add back to the capital for this P&L charge will be
incorporated?
Incurred CVA losses should be used to reduce EAD.
IV. Examples
A. CVA capital and RWA with no hedging
For this example, a bank has only two derivatives counterparties, Galaxy Financial with a AA
credit rating, and Solar Systems with a BB credit rating. The bank computes counterparty credit
risk (CCR) exposure as 800 for Galaxy, and 200 for Solar, following the requirements of the CCR
Standards. The bank uses the standardised approach rather than the simple alternative to
compute CVA capital and RWA.
The bank calculates the weighted average maturity for exposures to Galaxy at 3 years, and for
Solar 1 year. In this example, the bank has no eligible hedges for CVA risk for either counterparty.
Example: Derivatives Portfolio for the Bank
# Counterparty Name Credit Rating CCR Exposure Maturity
1 Galaxy Financial AA 800 3 years
2 Solar Systems BB 200 1 year
The bank must compute the supervisory discount factor, DF, for each of the two counterparties.

Using the formula in the Standards, the calculations are:

𝐷𝐹 = = 2.786
1 .05
(1−𝑒−.05×1)
𝐷𝐹 = = 0.975
2 .05
Using these supervisory discount factors, the bank calculates single-name exposure for each
counterparty, taking into account the fact that there are no eligible CVA hedges:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ×𝐷𝐹 = 800×2.786 =2229
1 1 1
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ×𝐷𝐹 = 200×0.975= 195
2 2 2
The bank must also determine the appropriate risk weights for each of these single-name
exposures. Because Galaxy is rated AA, the appropriate risk weight is 0.7% from Table 1 of the
Standards. Solar is rated BB, so the corresponding risk weight is 2.0%. That is, W =0.007, and

W =0.02.

= 2.33√95.06+182.52+11.41 = 2.33√288.99= 39.61
In the final step, the bank must compute RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as
required in the Standards:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 39.61 × 12.5 = 495.16
B. CVA capital and RWA with a single-name hedge
The bank from the previous example has the same portfolio, but in this example enters into a
CDS with a third party that provides protection on Galaxy Financial, to protect against a potential
increase in credit spreads that would reduce the fair value of transactions with Galaxy if Galaxy’s
credit quality deteriorates. The notional value of the CDS is 400, with a maturity of 2 years. Thus,
the calculation must now take into account the impact of an eligible single-name CVA hedge, with
H = 400 and M = 2.

The bank must compute the supervisory discount factor for the CVA hedge:
(1−𝑒−.05×2)

= (800×2.786)−(400×1.903)= 2228.7−761.3 ≈ 1467
The remainder of the computations proceed as before, with the new value for SNE :
1
𝐾 = 2.33√(0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 +0.5×𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2+0.75×(𝑊 ×𝑆𝑁𝐸 )2

= 2.33√(5.13+1.95)2+0.75×(10.27)2+0.75×(3.90)2
= 2.33√50.13+79.10+11.41= 2.33√140.64 =27.63
In the final step, the bank computes RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as
required in the Standards:
CVA RWA = K × 12.5 = 27.63 × 12.5 = 345.38
This example illustrates the impact of CVA risk mitigation, as the presence of the eligible CVA
hedge reduces CVA capital and RWA compared to the previous example with no hedging.

C. CVA capital and RWA with an index hedge
The bank from the previous example has the same portfolio, including the single-name hedge of
Galaxy Financial, but now enters into an index CDS that provides credit spread protection against
a basket of twenty named entities. The notional value of the index CDS is 300, with a maturity of
1.5 years. The bank’s calculation of CVA capital now takes into account the impact of an eligible
index hedge, which reduces systematic CVA risk. The relevant form of the calculation from the
Standard is:

𝑖 𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
Because the bank has only one index hedge, the summation for index hedges inside the
calculation has only a single (Wind Hind DFind) term. As stated above, the notional value of the
hedge is Hind=300. The bank needs to calculate the appropriate supervisory discount factor for
the index CDS, based on the maturity Mind=1.5 years:
(1−𝑒−.05×1.5)
𝐷𝐹 = = 1.445
𝑖𝑛𝑑 .05
To determine the risk weight, the bank must determine the credit rating for each of the twenty
reference names in the index basket, the corresponding risk weight for each rating (from Table 1
in the Standard), and the weighted average of those risk weights using the relative notional values
of the component names for the weights. Suppose that through this process of analysis, the bank
determines that the weighted average is 1.2% (slightly worse than BBB). As a result, Wind=0.012.
The impact of risk mitigation from the index CDS enters the calculation through the term:
𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 = 0.012×300×1.445= 5.20
𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑
The bank can now calculate CVA capital, taking into account the impact of the index hedge that
mitigates systematic risk. Many of the relevant values are unchanged from the previous example,

As before, the bank computes RWA for CVA using the multiplicative factor of 12.5 as required in
the Standard:

VI. Equity Investments in Funds
I. Introduction
In December 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a
revised framework for calculating the capital requirements for banks’ equity investments in funds
held in the banking book. This followed a BCBS review of the risk-based capital requirements for
banks’ exposures to funds, undertaken as part of the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking. The BCBS review was undertaken
to clarify the existing treatment of such exposures in the Basel II capital adequacy framework and
to achieve a more internationally consistent and risk-sensitive capital treatment for banks’
investments in the equity of funds, reflecting both the risk of the fund’s underlying investments
and its leverage.
Following the approach developed by the BCBS in Capital requirements for banks’ equity
investments in funds, (BCBS 266, published December 2013), the Central Bank Standards for
minimum required capital for banks’ equity investments in funds relies on a hierarchy of three
successive approaches to risk weighting of fund assets, with varying degrees of risk sensitivity
and conservatism:
 The “look-through approach” (LTA): The LTA is the most granular approach. Subject to
meeting the conditions set out for its use, banks employing the LTA must apply the risk
weight of the fund’s underlying exposures as if the exposures were held directly by the
bank;
 The “mandate-based approach” (MBA): The MBA provides a degree of risk sensitivity,
and can be used when banks do not meet the conditions for applying the LTA. Banks
employing the MBA assign risk weights on the basis of the information contained in a
fund’s mandate or in relevant regulations, national legislation, or other similar rules under
which the fund is required to operate; and
 The “fall-back approach” (FBA): When neither of the above approaches is feasible, the
FBA must be used. The FBA applies a 1250 percent risk weight to a bank’s equity
investment in the fund.
To ensure that banks have appropriate incentives to enhance the risk management of their
exposures, the degree of conservatism increases with each successive approach.
The capital framework for banks’ equity investments in funds also incorporates a leverage
adjustment to the risk-weighted assets derived from the above approaches to appropriately reflect
a fund’s leverage.

II. Clarifications
A. Scope
The Standards covers banks’ equity investments held in the banking book. Note that equity
positions within the trading book are covered by the market risk capital requirements that apply
to trading book positions.
The Central Bank has chosen not to use the national discretion provided within the BCBS
framework to exclude from the standard equity positions in entities whose debt obligations qualify
for a zero risk weight. The Central Bank also has chosen not to use the national discretion
provided within the BCBS framework to exclude from the scope of the standard equity investments
made under identified official programs that support specified sectors of the economy
B. General Design of the Capital Requirement
At a high level, the framework is designed such that the risk-weight for a bank’s equity
investment in a fund depends on the average risk weight that would be applicable to the assets
of the fund, and on the extent of use of leverage by the fund. The approach to the average risk
weight for any fund will reflect one or more of the three approaches described briefly above (and
described more fully in the Standards).
The illustration below gives a general overview of how the average risk weight and
leverage are combined, subject to a cap of 1250%, and then applied to the bank’s equity
investment in the funds.
For example, if the average risk weight of the assets held by the fund is 80%, and the fund
is financed through half debt and half equity, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 2.0 and
the risk weight applied to a bank’s investment in the fund would be:
80% x 2.0 = 160%
If instead the same fund is financed 90% by debt, then the ratio of assets to equity would be 10,
and the risk weight applied to the bank’s investment in the fund would be 800% (80% x 10).
Another way to view the capital requirement for equity investments in funds is that a bank
generally must count a proportional amount of the risk-weighted assets (RWA) of the fund as the
bank’s own RWA for capital purposes, in proportion to the bank’s share of the equity of the fund.
Ignoring the 1250% limit for simplicity, the RWA calculation can be written as:
𝑅𝑊𝐴 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑅𝑊𝐴 = ( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×( 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑 )×𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘′𝑠 𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

The rearrangement of the terms in the equation highlights that the bank’s RWA from the EIF is
the bank’s proportional share of the fund’s RWA – if the bank holds a 5% share of the equity in
the fund, then the bank’s RWA is 5% of the total RWA of the fund. This is a logical treatment – if
a bank effectively owns 5% of a fund, the bank must hold capital as if it owns 5% of the fund’s
risk-weighted assets.
C. Look-Through Approach
The LTA requires a bank to assign the same risk weights to the underlying exposures of
a fund as would be assigned if the bank held the exposures directly. The information used for to
determine the risk weights must meet the requirements stated in the Standards, including
sufficiency, frequency, and third party review. However, that information is not required to be
derived from sources that are subject to an external audit.
RWA and assets of investment funds should, to the extent possible, be evaluated using
the same accounting standards the bank would apply if the assets were held directly. However,
where this is not possible due to constraints on available information, the evaluation can be based
on the accounting standards applied by the investment fund, provided the treatment of the
numerator (RWA) and the denominator (total unweighted assets) is consistent.
If a bank relies on third-party calculations for determining the underlying risk weights of
the exposures of the fund, the risk weights should be increased by a factor of 1.2 times to
compensate for the fact that the bank cannot be certain about the accuracy of third-party
information. For instance, any exposure that is ordinarily subject to a 20% risk weight under the
risk-based capital standards would be weighted at 24% (1.2×20%) when the look-through is
performed by a third party.
D. Mandate-Based Approach
Under the MBA, banks may use the information contained in a fund’s mandate, or in the
rules or regulations governing such investment funds in the relevant jurisdiction. Information used
for this purpose is not strictly limited to a fund’s mandate or to national regulations or other
requirements that govern such funds. For example, a bank could obtain information from the
fund’s prospectus or from other disclosures of the fund.
To ensure that all underlying risks are taken into account (including CCR) and that the
MBA renders capital requirements no less than the LTA, the Standards requires that risk-weighted
assets for funds’ exposures be calculated as the sum of three items:
 On-balance-sheet exposures;
 Off-balance-sheet exposures including notional value of derivatives exposures; and
 CCR exposure for derivatives.

As with the LTA, for purposes of the MBA the RWA and assets of investment funds should,
to the extent possible, be evaluated using the same accounting standards the bank would apply
if the assets were held directly. However, where this is not possible due to constraints on available
information, the evaluation can be based on the accounting standards applied by the investment
fund, provided the treatment of the numerator (RWA) and the denominator (total unweighted
assets) is consistent.
In general, the MBA aims to take a conservative approach by calculating the highest risk-
weighted assets the fund could achieve under the terms of its mandate or governing laws and
regulations. Under the MBA, the bank should assume that the fund’s assets are first invested to
the maximum extent allowable in assets that would attract the highest risk weight, and then to the
maximum extent allowable in the next riskiest type of asset, and so on until all of the fund’s
balance sheet assets have been assigned to a risk-weight category. If more than one risk weight
could be applied to a given exposure, the bank must use the maximum applicable risk weight. For
example, if the mandate does not place restrictions on the rating quality of the fund’s investments
in corporate bonds, the bank should apply a risk weight of 150% to the fund’s corporate bond
positions.
For derivatives, when the replacement cost is unknown, the Standards takes a
conservative approach by setting replacement cost equal to the notional amount of the derivatives
contracts. When the notional amount of a fund’s derivative exposure is unknown, the approach
again is conservative: the bank should use the maximum notional amount of derivatives allowed
under the fund’s mandate. When the PFE for derivatives is unknown, the PFE add-on should be
set at 15% of the notional value. Thus, if the replacement cost and PFE add-on both are unknown,
a total multiplication factor of 1.15 must be applied to the notional amount to reflect the CCR
exposure.
Instead of determining a CVA charge associated with the fund’s derivative exposures, the
Standards allows banks to multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk
weight associated with the counterparty. However, a bank is not required to apply the 1.5 factor
for situations in which the CVA capital charge would not otherwise be applicable. Notably, this
includes derivative transactions for which the direct counterparty is a qualifying central
counterparty.
E. Leverage Adjustment
A leverage adjustment is applied to the average risk weight of the fund under either the
LTA or the MBA. A similar leverage adjustment is not necessary for the FBA, because the risk
weight of 1250% applied under the FBA to equity investments in funds is fixed at that maximum
value.
When determining the leverage adjustment under the MBA, banks are required to make
conservative assumptions using information from the fund’s mandate. Specifically, the Standards
requires that banks assume the fund will use financial leverage up to the maximum amount
permitted under the fund’s mandate, or up to the maximum permitted under the regulations
governing that fund. This maximum may be significantly greater than the actual leverage for the
fund at any point in time.

III. Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: BCBS 266 states “Equity holdings in entities whose debt obligations qualify
for a zero risk weight can be excluded from the LTA, MBA and FBA approaches (including
those publicly sponsored entities where a zero risk weight can be applied), at the
discretion of the national supervisor.” Are such equity holdings excluded under the
Central Bank’s Standards?
No, the Central Bank of the UAE has chosen not to adopt this point of national discretion. Bank
investments in such funds are subject to the requirements of the Standards.
Question 2: If a bank makes a “seed capital investment” in a fund that is out of scope of
consolidation, and is considered a significant investment in the common shares of a
banking, financial, or insurance entity, is it within scope as an equity investment in a fund?
If the investment is one that the bank would be required to deduct from capital, then the investment
is not in scope for this Standards.
Question 3: If a bank makes a “seed capital investment” in a fund, and that fund is managed
by a Fund Manager hired by the bank, is the investment considered to be a direct investment
in the fund, or indirect?
Assuming that the fund in question is not consolidated into the bank under accounting rules for
financial reporting, such an investment is considered a direct investment under the Standards.
Question 4: Under the Standards, what methodology should a bank use to compute
counterparty credit risk exposure for funds in which the bank has an equity investment?
The Standards states that banks must risk weight all exposures as if the bank held those
exposures directly. Thus, the risk weights and the exposure amounts for counterparty credit risk
should be determined using the standards that would apply to the bank. For banks in the UAE,
the applicable standards for counterparty credit risk is the Central Bank’s Standards for
Counterparty Credit Risk Capital, which reflects the Standardised Approach to Counterparty
Credit Risk (SA-CCR).
Question 5: If a bank relies on a third-party information provider for information used to
calculate the leverage adjustment for a fund, does the 1.2 multiplication factor apply?
No, as the Standards states, the factor of 1.2 applies when the bank relies on a third party for the
risk weights of the underlying exposures. This is a conservative adjustment to recognize the
uncertainty associated with such information about risk weights. It does not apply to the leverage
ratio calculation.
Question 6: The FBA applies a risk weight of 1250%, which is significantly higher than the
current risk weights of 100% or 150% that apply to equity investments in funds under
previous capital requirements. Should this risk weight be lower?
The risk weight of 1250% is aligned with international capital standards as developed by the Basel
Committee, and is being adopted by the Central Bank under this Standards. Considering the
higher minimum capital requirements in the UAE (10.5% vs 8%), the final risk weight is capped at
952%.
Question 7: What happens when the bank has mandated intermediaries to invest in fixed
income? Would this investment be included or excluded in the calculation of Equity
Investments?
86

[Document: document.pdf, Page 89]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Banks having mandated Intermediaries have to go through same framework approach. This
means that if the bank has information for these intermediaries, the bank may use the LTA
approach. If the bank does not have information, then it has to use the MBA or FBA approach.
Question 8: The EIF standards allows for partial use of approaches for reporting EIF and
the RWA calculations from each applied approach are summed, and then divided by total
fund assets to compute “Avg RWfund”. Should the leverage of the fund be proportioned
according to use of approach?
No, the leverage ratio is a single number that applies to the entire fund. When a bank uses more
than one approach to determine the risk weight (that is, LTA, MBA, and/or FBA), the bank should
report the amounts on separate lines in the reporting template.

IV. Example Calculations
A. Example of calculation of risk-weighted assets using the LTA
Consider a fund that aims to replicate an equity index using a strategy based on forward
contracts. Assume the fund holds short-term forward contracts for this purpose with a notional
amount of 100 that are cleared through a qualifying central counterparty. Further, assume that
the fund’s financial position can be represented by the following T-account balance sheet:
Assets Liabilities and Equity
Cash 20 Notes payable 5
Government bonds (AAA) 30
Variation margin receivable
on forward contracts 50 Equity 95
100 100
Finally, assume that the bank’s equity investment in the fund comprises 20% of the shares of the
fund, and therefore is 20% × 95 = 19.
Using the LTA, the fund’s balance sheet exposures of 100 are risk weighted according to the risk
weights that would be applied to these assets by the bank. For cash, the risk weight is 0%; for the
government bonds, the risk weight is also 0%. The margin receivable is an exposure to a
qualifying CCP, which has 2% risk weight. The underlying risk weight for equity exposures (100%)
is applied to the notional amount of the forward contracts.
Assume that the bank is able to determine that the amount of the CCR exposure to the CCP is
10, which then receives the 2% risk weight for exposures to a qualifying CCP. Note that there is
no CVA charge because the forward contracts are cleared through the qualifying CCP.
The total RWA for the fund is:
20×0% + 30×0% + 50×2% + 100×100% + 10×2% = 101.2
Given the total assets of the fund of 100, the average risk-weight for the fund is:
Avg RW = 101.2 / 100 = 101.2%
fund
With fund assets of 100 and fund equity of 95, leverage is calculated as the assets-to-equity ratio,
or 100/95≈1.05. Therefore, the risk-weight for the bank’s equity investment in the fund is:
Risk Weight = 101.2% × (100/95) = 106.5%
Applying this risk weight to the bank’s equity investment in the fund of 19, the bank’s RWA on the
position for the purpose of calculating minimum required capital is 106.5% × 19 = 20.24.
B. Example of calculation of risk-weighted assets using the MBA
Consider a fund with current balance-sheet assets of 100, and assume that the bank is
unable to apply the LTA due to a lack of adequate information. Suppose that the fund’s mandate
states that the fund’s investment objective is to replicate an equity index. In addition to being
