The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade: in particular, since Trade 1
and Trade 3 are long in the primary risk factor (CDS spread), their delta is 1; in contrast, the
supervisory delta for Trade 2 is -1.
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward and swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Thus, the entity-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory
delta times the maturity factor (where the maturity factor is 1 for all three derivatives).

Supervisory Factor
The add-on must now be calculated for each entity. Note that all derivatives refer to different
entities (single names/indices). A supervisory factor is assigned to each single-name entity based
on the rating of the reference entity, as specified in Table 1 in the relevant Standards. This means
assigning a supervisory factor of 0.38% for AA-rated firms (Trade 1) and 0.54% for BBB-rated
firms (for Trade 2). For CDS indices (Trade 3), the supervisory factor is assigned according to
whether the index is investment or speculative grade; in this example, its value is 0.38% since the
index is investment grade.

Thus, the entity level add-ons are as follows:
Add-on(Entity) = SF × Effective Notional
Trade Effective Notional Supervisory factor SF Add-on (Entity)
Trade 1 27,858,405 0.38% 105,862
Trade 2 -51,836,356 0.54% -279,916
Trade 3 44,239,843 0.38% 168,111
Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The add-on calculation separates the entity level add-ons into systematic and idiosyncratic
components, which are combined through weighting by the correlation factor. The correlation
parameter ρ is equal to 0.5 for the single-name entities (Trade 1-Firm A and Trade 2-Firm B) and
0.8 for the index (Trade 3-CDX.IG) in accordance with the requirements of the Standards.

Add-on Aggregation
For this netting set, the interest rate add-on is also the aggregate add-on because there are no
trades assigned to other asset classes. Thus, the aggregate add-on = 346,878
Aggregation of entity-level add-ons with full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component.

Thus,
Add-on = [ (47,462)2 + 77,344,042,776 ]1/2 = 282,129

multiplier = min {1; Floor+(1-Floor) × exp [(V-C)/(2×(1-Floor)×Add-on agg)] }
= min {1; 0.05 + 0.95 × exp [-20,000 / (2 × 0.95 × 282,129)]}
=0.96521

= 0.96521 × 282,129= 272,313
3. EAD Calculation
The exposure that would be risk-weighted for the purpose of counterparty credit risk capital
requirements is therefore:
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (0 + 272,313) = 381,238
C. Illustration 3
Consider a netting set with three commodity forward contracts. All notional amounts and market
values are denominated in USD. This netting set is not subject to a margin agreement and there
is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below
summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three commodity derivatives.
Trade Nature Underlying Position Direction Residual Notional Market value
# maturity (thousands) (thousands)
1 Forward (WTI) Protection Long 9 months 10,000 -50

2 Forward (Brent) Protection Short 2 years 20,000 -30

1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives’ market values at the reference date, provided that value is positive. Thus,
using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {100 - 30 - 50; 0} = 20
The replacement cost is positive and there is no exchange of collateral (so the bank has not
received excess collateral), which means the multiplier will be equal to 1.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation, for each of
the four commodity hedging sets with non-zero exposure:

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward & swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Since the remaining maturity of Trade 1 is less than a year, at nine months (approximately 187
business days), and the trade is un-margined, its maturity factor is scaled down by the square
root of 187/250 in accordance with the requirements of the Standards. On the other hand, the
maturity factor is 1 for Trade 2 and for Trade 3, since the remaining maturity of those two trades
is greater than one year and they are un-margined.
The trade-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory delta
times the maturity factor. The basic difference between the WTI and Brent forward contracts
effectively is ignored since they belong to the same commodity type, namely “Crude Oil” within
the “Energy” hedging set, thus allowing for full offsetting. (In contrast, if one of the two forward
contracts were on a different commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set, such as natural
gas, with the other on crude oil, then only partial offsetting would have been allowed between the
two trades.) Therefore, Trade 1 and Trade 2 can be aggregated into a single effective notional,
taking into account each trade’s supervisory delta and maturity factor.
