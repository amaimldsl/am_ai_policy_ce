C. Alternative Standardised Approach
Question 6: What exposure indicator is used in the ASA approach?
In the ASA, gross income is replaced by the credit volume in terms of outstanding loans and
advances (L&A) multiplied by a factor m (fixed at 0.035), as the exposure indicator for retail and
commercial banking business lines. The loans and advances are non-risk weighted and gross of
provisions.
Question 7: Why is the volume-based indicator alternative provided?
This volume-based indicator is provided to avoid large differences in the operational risk
requirement caused by differences in income margins across banks and jurisdictions in these
business lines. Gross income is not anappropriate exposure indicator of the extent of operational
risk in retail and commercial lending.
Question 8: Can a bank choose to adopt ASA on its own?
No, the Central Bank must be satisfied that the alternative approach provides an improved basis
for calculating the capital charge for operational risk in the bank. Reverting to the SA after adopting
ASA is only possible with the approval of the Central Bank.
Question 9: What comprises Commercial Loans and Advances?
Under the ASA, commercial loans and advances will include outstanding amounts (non-risk
weighted and gross of provisions) averaged over the past three years, from the following credit
portfolios:
Commercial loans included for ASA Definitions
Corporates Loans to a corporation, partnership or
proprietorship firm
Sovereigns Loans to sovereigns and their central banks,
certain public sector enterprises and
multilateral development banks
Banks Loans to other banks and regulated
securities firms
Specialised lending Loans for project finance, object finance,
commodities finance, income producing real
estate and commercial real estate
Small and medium enterprises treated as Loans to small and medium enterprises
corporates belonging to a group with annual gross
turnover that exceeds AED 250 million
Purchased corporate receivables Bank finance against amounts due to
corporates from third parties for goods
and/or services provided by them.
Book value of securities held in the banking The value at which securities have been
book purchased rather than their market value.
Securities that are held in the banking book
are intended to be held until maturity. There
is no intent of trading in these securities.
Question 10: What comprises Retail Loans?
For the purpose of the ASA, retail loans will include total outstanding amounts (non-risk weighted
131

CBUAE Classification: Public
and gross of provisions) averaged over the past three years in the following credit portfolios:
Retail loans included for ASA Definitions
Retail Exposures to individuals, residential
mortgage loans etc.
SMEs treated as retail Loans extended to small and medium
businesses and managed as retail
exposures by the bank.
Purchased retail receivables Bank finance against amounts due to
bank’s retail clients from third parties for
goods and/or services provided by them
Question 11: What is the threshold to decide a large diversified bank in terms of assets
book size/composition or any other indicators?
Currently, there is no such threshold. The Central Bank will perform an assessment for each bank
applying to qualify for ASA. The qualifying criteria provided in paragraph 28 of the Operational
Risk section of Standards re Capital Adequacy in the UAE, especially the first one (90% income
from retail/commercial banking) are stringent. The Central Bank will review whether the bank
meets the 90% standard to determine whether an additional size cut-off is appropriate.
Question 12: Retail or commercial banking activities shall account for at least 90% of its
income. Please clarify whether this needs to be seen in the current year or an average of
all the 3 years based on which the Operational Risk capital is being computed
Testing the 90% rule across a period of three consecutive years willbe more appropriate.
Question 13: "The bank's operational risk management processes and assessment system
shall be subject to validation and regular independent review". Can we get clarification on
the difference between the validation and the review, and what are the scope and
responsible party for each?
Validation of models and tables must be performed by the internal auditor or by the external
auditor.
Question 14: In terms of the "regular reporting", is an official ORM meeting required? For
example, Operational Risk Business/ Country / Group Committee meetings?
It is up to the bank how it conveys the regular reports to the senior management and the board of
directors, but the evidence of these reports were submitted needs to be documented for example
senior management signatures on the reports.
Question 15: Is operational risk capital charge revision a quarterly activity going forward
or it remains as a yearly activity at the end of the year?
Will it be more adequate if we use current years’ gross income to compute operational risk
rather last year's audited numbers only.
If the quarterly income is audited, the bank should use the quarterly data, which means the same
quarter in the previous two years needs to be taken into consideration or else, the yearly audited
data needs to be incorporated
The standards state only audited numbers need to be used and as such, if the current year’s
income is audited, it can be used as part of the computation
Question 16: Elaboration of definition and scope of Operational Risk should be helpful.
For example, whether Operational Risk includes other risk types such as Fraud Risk,
132

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 132]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Business Continuity Risk etc.
The definition and scope of Operational risk is sufficiently elaborated in the Operational Risk
Standard of the Capital Adequacy Standards of Banks in the UAE and the Operational Risk
Guidance. If operational risks were not sufficiently covered under Pillar I, then the uncovered
risk should be part of the Pillar 2 ICAAP calculation.
Question 17: As per the definition of gross income, "income derived from insurance" is to
be excluded from the income while computing Operational RWA.
We wouldrequest clarification if this also refers to bancassurance i.e. Bank's commission
income earned on insurance products that are sold on behalf of insurance companies."
Any income which the bank earns out of the bancassurace should be treated as income derived
from insurance.
