H. Complex Derivatives
24. The Standards requires that complex trades with more than one risk driver (e.g. multi-
asset or hybrid derivatives) must be allocated to more than one asset class when the material risk
drivers span more than one asset class. The full amount of the trade must be included in the PFE
calculation for each of the relevant asset classes. Asset-class allocation of complex derivatives is
a point of national discretion in the Basel framework, and the Central Bank believes that requiring
banks to identify such trades and allocate them accordingly places appropriate responsibility on
banks that choose to engage in such trades.
25. Examples of derivatives that reference the basis between two risk factors and are
denominated in a single currency (basis transactions) include three-month Libor versus six-month
Libor, three-month Libor versus three-month T-Bill, one-month Libor versus OIS rate, or Brent
Crude oil versus Henry Hub gas. These examples are provided as illustrations, and do not
represent an exhaustive list.
26. Hedging sets for derivatives that reference the volatility of a risk factor (volatility
transactions) must follow the same hedging set construction outlined in the Standards for
derivatives in that asset class; for example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging
set. Examples of volatility transactions include variance and volatility swaps, or options on realized
or implied volatility.
I. Unrated Reference Assets
27. The supervisory factor for credit derivatives depends on the credit rating of the underlying
reference asset. The Basel framework does not provide a specific treatment of unrated reference
assets. The Central Bank believes that credit derivatives on unrated reference entities are likely
to be rare. However, for the sake of completeness, the Standards requires that any such credit
derivatives be treated in a manner that is broadly consistent with the treatment of unrated entities
in other aspects of the risk-based capital framework, through use of a Supervisory Factor
corresponding to BBB or BB ratings as described in the Standards.
28. For an entity for which a credit rating is not available, a bank should use the Supervisory
Factor corresponding to BBB. However, where the exposure is associated with an elevated risk
of default, the bank should use the Supervisory Factor for BB. In this context, “elevated risk of
default” should also be understood to include instances in which it is difficult or impossible to
assess adequately whether the exposure has high risk of loss due to default by the obligor. A
bank trading credit derivatives referencing unrated entities should conduct their own analysis to
examine this risk.
J. Commodity Derivatives
29. Note that the Standards defines the term “commodity type” for purposes of calculation of
exposure for CCR. A commodity type is defined as a set of commodities with broadly similar risk
drivers, such that the prices or volatilities of commodities of the same commodity type may
reasonably be expected to move with similar direction and timing and to bear predictable
relationships to one another. For example, a commodity type such as coal might include several
types of coal, and a commodity type such as oil might include oil of different grades from different
sources. The prices of commodities of a given type may not move precisely in lock step, but they
are likely to move in the same direction at roughly the same time, due to their dependence on
common forces in commodity markets. Long and short trades within a single commodity type can
be fully offset.

30. For commodity derivatives, defining individual commodity types is operationally difficult. In
fact, it is generally not possible to fully specify all relevant distinctions between commodity types,
and as a result, a single commodity type is likely to include individual commodities that in practice
differ to some extent in the dynamic behaviour they exhibit. As a result, not all basis risk is likely
to be captured. Nonetheless, banks should attempt to minimize unrecognized basis risk through
sound definitions of commodity types.
31. The Standards requires a bank to establish appropriate governance processes for the
creation and maintenance of the list of defined commodity types used by the bank for CCR
calculations, with clear definitions and independent internal review or validation processes to
ensure that commodities grouped as a single type are in fact similar. A bank can only use the
specifically defined commodity types it has established through its adequately controlled internal
processes.
32. Trades within the same commodity hedging set (Energy, Metals, Agriculture, and Other)
enjoy partial offsetting through the use of correlation values established in the Standards, with
correlation values varying by asset subclass. More specifically, partial offsetting applies only to
the systematic component, not the issuer-specific or idiosyncratic component. Note that Electricity
is a sub-class of the Commodity asset class, but is itself part of the broader Energy hedging set,
rather than constituting a distinct hedging set.
K. Single-Name and Index Derivatives
33. For credit derivatives, there is one credit reference entity for each reference debt
instrument that underlies a single-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category. Single-
name transactions should be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the
underlying reference debt instrument of those transactions is issued by the same issuer.
34. The approach for establishing the reference entity for equity derivatives should correspond
to the general approach for credit derivatives.
35. For credit derivatives with indices as the underlying instrument, there should be one
reference entity for each group of reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives
that underlie a multi-name transaction. Multi-name transactions should be assigned to the same
credit reference entity only where the group of underlying reference debt instruments or single-
name credit derivatives of those transactions has the same constituents. The determination of
whether an index is investment grade or speculative grade should be based on the credit quality
of the majority of its individual constituents.
36. Again, the approach for equity index derivatives should follow the general approach for
credit index derivatives.
L. Special Cases of Margin Agreements
37. When multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, the netting set should be
broken down into sub-netting sets that align with the respective margin agreement for calculating
both RC and PFE.
38. When a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, RC at any given time is
determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the un-margined current exposure
of the bank to the counterparty aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement
reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. collateral is subtracted only when the bank is a
43

[Document: PI.pdf, Page 43]
CBUAE Classification: Public
net receiver of collateral). The second term is non-zero only when the bank is a net poster of
collateral: it is equal to the current net posted collateral (if there is any) reduced by the un-
margined current exposure of the counterparty to the bank aggregated across all netting sets
within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the bank should include both VM and
NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is:
𝑅𝐶 =𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ max(0;𝑉 )−max (0;𝐶 ))+𝑚𝑎𝑥(0 ; ∑ min(0;𝑉 )−min (0;𝐶 ))
𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆 𝑀𝐴
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴 𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
where the summation NS ∈ MA is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement
(hence the notation), V is the current mark-to-market value of the netting set NS and C is the
NS MA
cash equivalent value of all currently available collateral under the margin agreement.
39. An alternative description of this calculation is as follows:
Step 1: Compute the net value, positive or negative, of each netting set. These calculated
values correspond to the terms V
NS
in the expression above.
Step 2: Sum the values of all netting sets with positive value, to get Total Positive Value
(TPV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑃𝑉 = ∑ max (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 3: Sum the values of all of netting sets with negative value, to get Total Negative
Value (TNV). This corresponds to the term in the expression above:
𝑇𝑁𝑉 = ∑ min (𝑉 ;0)
𝑁𝑆
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
Step 4: Calculate the net current cash value of collateral, including NICA and VM. This
corresponds to the term C in the expression above. If the bank is net holder of
MA
collateral, then C is positive; it is the net value held (NVH). If the bank is a net
MA
provider of collateral, then C is negative, and its absolute value is the net value
MA
provided (NVP). Note that either NVH>0 and NVP=0, or NVP>0 and NVH=0.
One of the following cases then applies:
Step 5a: If NVH>0 (so NVP=0), then RC = TPV – NVH, but with a minimum of zero
– that is, RC cannot be negative.
or
Step 5b: If NVH=0 (so NVP>0), then RC = TPV + NVP – TNV, but with a minimum
of TPV – that is, RC cannot be less than TPV.
40. To calculate PFE when a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, netting
set level un-margined PFEs should be calculated and aggregated, i.e. PFE should be calculated
as the sum of all the individual netting sets considered as if they were not subject to any form of
margin agreement.

IV. Frequently Asked Questions
A. Netting
Question A1: Does a bank need written approval for each netting agreement it has in place,
or will the Central Bank provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties?
The bank should establish an internal process that considers the factors identified in the
Standards. That process should be subject to internal review and challenge per the Standards.
The Central Bank will review the identification of netting sets as part of the supervisory process,
and notify the bank of any determinations that netting is not appropriate. The Central Bank will
not provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties.
Question A2: Do amendments to existing netting agreements require approval from the
Central Bank?
Amendments that do not raise new questions about the validity of netting need not be raised to
the Central Bank for consideration.
Question A3: What if netting is not valid? Can netting sets still be used for the calculation?
