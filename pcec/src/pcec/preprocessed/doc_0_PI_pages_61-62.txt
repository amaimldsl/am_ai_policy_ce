The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward & swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Since the remaining maturity of Trade 1 is less than a year, at nine months (approximately 187
business days), and the trade is un-margined, its maturity factor is scaled down by the square
root of 187/250 in accordance with the requirements of the Standards. On the other hand, the
maturity factor is 1 for Trade 2 and for Trade 3, since the remaining maturity of those two trades
is greater than one year and they are un-margined.
The trade-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory delta
times the maturity factor. The basic difference between the WTI and Brent forward contracts
effectively is ignored since they belong to the same commodity type, namely “Crude Oil” within
the “Energy” hedging set, thus allowing for full offsetting. (In contrast, if one of the two forward
contracts were on a different commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set, such as natural
gas, with the other on crude oil, then only partial offsetting would have been allowed between the
two trades.) Therefore, Trade 1 and Trade 2 can be aggregated into a single effective notional,
taking into account each trade’s supervisory delta and maturity factor.

Supervisory Factor
For each commodity-type in a hedging set, the effective notional amount must be multiplied by
the correct Supervisory Factor (SF).As described in the Standards, the Supervisory Factor for

both the Crude Oil commodity type in the Energy hedging set and the Silver commodity type in
the Metals hedging set is SF=18%.
Thus, the add-on by hedging set and commodity type is as follows:

Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The commodity-type add-ons in a hedging set aredecomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic
components. The commodity subclass correlations parameters are as stated in the Standards, in
this case 40% for commodities.
Thus, the hedging set level add-ons are calculated for each commodity hedging set:
Add­on(COM) = [( Σ

Metals Silver 40% 1,800 (720)2 0.84 0.84 × (1,800)2 1,800
However, in this example, since only one commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set is
populated (i.e. all other commodity types within that hedging set have a zero add-on), the resulting
add-on for the hedging set is the same as the add-on for the commodity type. This calculation
shows that when there is only one commodity type within a commodity hedging set, the hedging-
set add-on is equal to the absolute value of the commodity-type add-on. (The same comment
applies to the commodity type “Silver” in the “Metals” hedging set.)
Add-on Aggregation
Aggregation of commodity-type add-ons uses full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component in each hedging set. As noted earlier, in this
example there is only one commodity type per hedging set, which means no offsetting benefits.
Computing the simple summation of absolute values of add-ons for the hedging sets:
Add-on = Σ Add-on
j j
Add-On = 2,043 + 1,800 = 3,843

Multiplier
The multiplier is given by
multiplier = min { 1; Floor+(1-Floor) × exp [(V-C) /(2 ×(1-Floor)×Add-on agg)] }
= min {1; 0.05 + 0.95 × exp [20 / (2 × 0.95 × 3,843)]}
= 1, since V-C is positive.
Final Calculation of PFE
PFE = multiplier × Add-on
agg
= 1 × 3,843 = 3,843
3. EAD Calculation
The exposure EAD to be risk weighted for counterparty credit risk capital requirements
purposes is therefore
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (20 + 3,843) = 5,408

VI. Illustrations of Replacement Cost Calculations with Margining
Calculation of Replacement Cost (RC) depends whether or not a trade is collateralized, as

 MTA = minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty
 NICA = net independent collateral amount other than variation margin (unsegregated or
segregated) posted to the bank, minus the unsegregated collateral posted by the bank.
The quantityTH + MTA – NICA represents the largest net exposure, including all
collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral
call.
A. Illustration 1: Margined Transaction
A bank has AED80 million in trades with a counterparty. The bank currently has met all past
variation margin (VM) calls, so the value of trades with the counterparty is offset by cumulative
VM in the form of cash collateral received. Furthermore, an “Independent Amount” (IA) of AED 10
million was agreed in favour of the bank, and none in favour of its counterparty. This leads to a
