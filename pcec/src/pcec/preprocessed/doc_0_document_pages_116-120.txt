paragraphs 41 to 45). However, counterparty credit risk is still to be considered.
Question 19: Treatment of Options: Do banks have to meet certain criteria to apply the
simplified approach or the delta plus method? Or is the choice of method fully within
bank's discretion?
As per Para 82 (Standard), two alternative approaches apply to options. Banks that only
purchase options (rather than written options) can choose to use a simplified approach. Unless
all written option positions (under the simplified approach) are hedged by perfectly matched long
positions in exactly the same options, in which case no capital charge for market risk is
required. Banks with more complex option positions that also write options must use the delta-
plus approach rather than the simplified approach.
Question 20: Specific Interest Rate Risk: When the securities are not externally credit
rated, does the Central Bank have a list of specific treatment for issuers/ issues that are
unrated?
The Central Bank does not have a discretionary list of customers that do receive a special
treatment if an external rating is not available.
 The standard is exhaustive for all special treatments. For example: UAE and GCC
sovereign exposure that are funded and denominated in the domestic currency receive
0% RW (independent of the external rating of that sovereign)
 Exposures to the Federal Government and Emirates Government receive 0% risk weight,
if such exposures are denominated and funded in AED or USD for a transition period of
7 years from the date of implementation of this Standard. After the transition period, 0%
risk weights are only applied to exposures that are denominated and funded in AED.
Question 21: If a bank has exposure in equity investments in the trading book, how will
this exposure be treated under Market risk?
Risk-weighted assets for equity exposures arising from bank investments in funds that are held
in the trading book are subject to the market risk capital rules. Equity investments in funds will
be allocated to the trading book if the bank is able to “look through” to the fund’s underlying
assets (i.e. determine capital requirements based on the underlying positions held by the fund),
or where the bank has access both to daily price quotes and to the information contained in the
mandate of the fund. The reporting is based on the underlying positions held by the fund; it
could be covered under different areas of the market risk (e.g. FX, IRR and equity risk).
Question 22: As per paragraph 21 of the Market Risk Standard, it is mentioned that a
securitisation exposure subject to a risk weight of 1250% under the Central Bank
requirements (and therefore to a 100% specific risk charge under this Standard) may be
excluded from the calculation of capital for general market risk. Should the cap for the
113

UAE be 1250% or 952% as mentioned in paragraph 5 of the Introduction of the
standards?
Yes, the RW has to be capped at 952% as mentioned in the introduction of the standards.
V. Examples
Note that capital charges calculated in all examples below still need to be converted into
risk-weighted assets via Section IV in the Market Risk Standards.
A. Interest rate risk
1. Calculating the General Market risk charge
Calculate the general market risk capital charge for XYZ bank’s interest rate positions using the
maturity method.
Long position in a qualifying bond: Market value AED 13.33m. Residual maturity 8 years & coupon
8%
Long position in a government bond: Market value AED 75m. Residual maturity 2 months &
coupon 7%
Interest rate swap: Notional value AED 150m. Residual life of swap 8 years & bank receives
floating rate interest and pays fixed. Next interest fixing after 9 months
Long position in interest rate government bond future: Contract size AED 50mn.
The treatment of interest rate future positions assume a bank is exposed to a long position in a
6-month interest rate future bought today and settled in two months' time. The long position in
interest rates needs to be slotted into the 6-12 months’ time band because the maturity of the long
position is considered to be eight months. This is because the position is taken on today and will
be settled in two months with a maturity of six months.
Delivery date after 6 months & remaining maturity of the CTD government security 3.5 years.
Cheapest to deliver CTD refers to the underlying instrument that result in the greatest profit or the
least loss when delivered in satisfaction of futures contracts.
Calculating the general market risk capital charge comprises two main steps and a number of
sub-steps.
Step 1: Map each interest rate position
We are using the maturity method to map the positions. None of the bank’s positions have a
coupon of less than 3%, so we will use a ladder of 13 time bands. Each position is mapped to the
appropriate time band according to its residual maturity.
Step 2: calculate the total capital charge
Overall net open position
Zone 1 (months) Zone 2 (years) Zone 3 (years)

The net open position is the sum of all the positions across all the time bands. The net open
position is AED 3m short, which leads to a capital charge at 100% of AED 3,000,000.
Calculation:
+75*0.2%=+0.15
-50*0.4%=-0.2
+150*0.7%=+1.05
+50*2.25%=+1.125
-150*3.75%=-5.625
+13.33*3.75%=+0.5
Vertical disallowance
The long position of AED 0.5m is offset against the short position of AED 5.625m as per the
marked area. The matched position is AED 0.5m and the net open position is AED -5.125m.
This leads to a capital charge of 10% of AED 0.5m, or AED 50,000
Zone 1 (months) Zone 2 (years) Zone 3 (years)

disallowance 5.125
Calculation
Matched position = 0.5
Net open position = -5.625+0.5= -5.125
Horizontal disallowance
The third part of the capital charge is a charge for the horizontal disallowance. There are three
rounds of horizontal offsetting.
In round 1, the horizontal disallowance within each zone is calculated. In this example, charge
applies to zone 1 only because it is the only zone with a long and a short position. (With more
than one position). The short position, -0.2 is offset against the total long position, +1.2. The
matched position is 0.2 and the net open position is +1.
The capital charge for the horizontal disallowance within zone 1 is 40% of AED 0.2m, or AED
80,000
In round 2, calculate the horizontal disallowance between adjacent zones, i.e., between:
Zone 1 and zone 2
Zone 2 and zone 3
In this example, zone 1 and zone 2 both contain long positions, so there is no matched position
and therefore no offsetting between these zones. The long position of 1.125 in zone 2 is offset
against the short position of -5.125 in zone 3. The matched position is 1.125 and the net open
position is -4. The capital charge for the horizontal disallowance between zones 2 and 3 is 40%
of AED 1.125m= AED 450,000.
In round 3, we calculate the horizontal disallowance between zones 1 and 3.

In this example, the long position of 1 in zone 1 is offset against the short position of -4 in zone 3.
The matched position is 1 and the net open position is -3. The capital charge for the horizontal
disallowance between zones 1 and 3 is 100% of AED 1m = AED 1m.
After the three rounds of horizontal offsetting, the total charge for the horizontal disallowance is
AED 80,000 + AED 450,000 + AED 1,000,000 = AED 1,530,000
Having completed the horizontal and vertical offsetting, the remaining overall net open position is
AED 3m, which is equivalent to the overall net open position we calculated across all time bands
when we calculated the first part of the capital charge.

2. Specific Market Risk – Example
Relate to the same example as above.
Given that, the government bonds are AAA-rated and that the qualifying bond is BBB-rated.
The interest rate swap does not incur a specific risk charge. The AAA-rate government bonds
incur a 0% specific risk charge. The qualifying bond has a residual maturity of 8 years and is BBB-
rated, so if has a specific risk charge of 1.6%
The capital charge is 1.6% of AED 13.33m, or AED 213,280.

B. Equity Risk – Calculating the Capital Charge
Bank XYZ has the following positions in its equity portfolio for a particular national market.
Company Position No. of shares Market price Market value
(AED) (AED)
A Corp. Long 10,000 35 350,000
B Corp. Short 20,000 25 500,000
C Corp. Short 5,000 50 250,000
D Corp. Long 15,000 20 300,000
E Corp. Short 2,000 60 120,000
To calculate the general market risk charge, we must first determine the overall net open position.
The sum of the net long positions is AED 650,000 and the sum of the net short positions is AED
870,000. The overall net open position is short AED 220,000.
The capital charge for general market risk is 8% of AED 220,000, or AED 17,600.
Next, we must work out the specific risk charge.
The capital charge for specific risk is 8% of AED 1,520,000 or AED 121,600.
That lead to, overall capital charge for this portfolio is AED 17,600 + AED 121,000, or AED
139,200.
C. FX Risk – calculating the capital charge
Below is an example of calculating the capital charge for FX risk.
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency, United Arab dirhams (AED).
Currency JPY EUR GBP AUD USD Gold
Net position +50 +100 +150 -20 -180 -35
(AEDm)
The higher of the sum of the net long and net short currency positions is AED 300m.
The capital charge is therefore calculated as 8% of AED 300m, plus the net position in gold (AED
35m):
Capital charge = 8% of AED 335m = AED 26.8m
Another example;
A bank has the following positions that have been converted at spot rates into its reporting
currency (AED)
Currency EUR JPY GBP AUD SGD
Net position +150 -100 +75 -30 -15
(AEDm)
The sum of the net long positions is AED 225m and the sum of the net short positions is -AED
145m. The capital charge is calculated as 8% of the higher of these two positions, so the charge
is 8% of AED 225m, or AED 18m.
D. Commodity risk
1. Simplified approach
XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s reporting
currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:
117

[Document: document.pdf, Page 120]
CBUAE Classification: Public
Position Standard units (kg) Maturity
Long 128 4 months
Short -160 5 months
Long 96 13 months
Short -96 4 years
Firstly, calculate the current value for these positons in the reporting currency.
The following is the current situation:
Current spot price of the 5.00 EUR per kg
commodity per unit (kg) in
local currency
Current EUR/AED FX spot 4.25 1 EUR = 4.25 AED
rate
Further calculation to the position after conversion to local reporting bank’s currency
Position Standard Spot Value FX spot rate 1 Value (AED) Maturity
units (kg) price (EUR) EUR = 4.25 AED
Long 128 5.00 640 4.25 2,720 4 months
Short -160 5.00 -800 4.25 -3,400 5 months
Long 96 5.00 480 4.25 2,040 13 months
Short -96 5.00 -480 4.25 -2,040 4 years
640*4.25=2,720
-800*4.25=-3,400
480*4.25=2,040
-480*4.25=-2,040
Calculate the capital charge, first a capital charge of 15% of the overall net open position in the
commodity is required.
The overall net position is the sum of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 – AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 – AED 2,040 = - AED 680
The overall net positon is short AED 680. This leads to a capital charge of AED 102 (680 * 15%)
Next, a capital charge of 3% of the bank’s gross positon in the commodity is required.
The gross position is the sum of the absolute values of the long and short positions:
AED 2,720 + AED 3,400 + AED 2,040 + AED 2,040 = AED 10,200
XYZ bank’s gross position is AED 10,200. This leads to a capital charge of AED 306 (10,200 *
3%).
Now, sum the charges to find the total capital charge for this commodity. The charge for the overall
net open position is AED 102, and the charge for the bank’s gross position in the commodity is
AED 306.
Therefore, XYZ bank’s total market risk capital charge for positions held in this commodity is AED
102 + AED 306, or AED 408.
2. Maturity ladder approach
Recall that XYZ bank is exposed to a number of positions in the same commodity. The bank’s
reporting currency is AED. The following positions are held in EUR:
