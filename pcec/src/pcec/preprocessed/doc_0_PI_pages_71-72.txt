A minor difference in notation is the omission of the multiplicative term “√ℎ” from the BCBS
formulation. This term was included by the BCBS to allow the CVA capital calculation to be
adjusted to an appropriate prudential horizon. However, in the ultimate calibration of the CVA
calculation the horizon h was established at one year, and hence h=1. Since the square root of 1
is also 1, and the term is a multiplicative factor, it has no impact on the resulting capital. Some
other jurisdictions have recognized this fact, and have omitted the √ℎ from the CVA calculation
for simplicity in their published capital regulations. The Central Bank has followed this approach.
Another difference between the BCBS notation and thepresentation of the formula in the
Standards is the concept of “single-name exposure” or SNE. Under the Standards, a bank
calculates SNE for each counterparty as:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 − 𝐻 ×𝐷𝐹
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝐻
In this calculation, 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the bank’s total exposure to counterparty “i” across all derivatives
netting sets plus the co𝑖 unterparty exposure measure arising from SFTs with that counterparty,
and H is the total notional of eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. (The symbol
i
H is used in place of B in the BCBS formula, an appropriate adjustment of notation since it reflects
hedge instruments. DF is a supervisory discount factor, described further below.) In effect, the
discounted value of the individual counterparty exposure is offset by the discounted value of
eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. The Central Bank regards SNE as a useful
concept, because it reflects single-name exposure net of hedges. Its use also simplifies
presentation of the CVA capital formulas.
The form of the supervisory discount factor DF in the Standards differs somewhat from
the corresponding BCBS notation. Specifically, DF is defined in the CVA Standards as:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
𝐷𝐹 =
0.05
This form of DF is in effect the continuous-time present value of an M-period annuity of one AED
discounted at a rate of 5%.

In contrast, the BCBS formula includes the maturity term M directly in the denominator of
the supervisory discount factor, as follows:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
0.05×𝑀
However, the BCBS formula for CVA capital also multiplies by M as part of the CVA capital
calculation. As a result of that multiplication, the M in the denominator of the discount factor is
cancelled out, making the overall result the same as that provided by DF in the Standards. The
formulation in the BCBS text was designed to accommodate the fact that banks using internal
models incorporate discounting into the calculation of counterparty exposure, and those banks
are required to set the BCBS supervisory discount factor to one, while retaining the multiplication
by M. However, since internal-model approaches are not used for regulatory capital purposes in
the UAE, this flexibility is not needed, and the simpler version of the calculation has been specified
in the Standards. If for operational or other reasons a bank finds using the Basel formulation of
the discount factor more convenient, its use is acceptable, provided the bank also multiplies the
resulting discount factor by M.
If the bank uses single-name hedging only, the bank aggregates SNE across
counterparties to calculate CVA capital using the following formula:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
where K is CVA capital, and Wi is the risk weight applicable to counterparty “i” taken from the
risk- weight table in the Standards.
An important insight is that CVA risk has both a systematic component and an idiosyncratic
component. The systematic component reflects the fact that credit risks of different counterparties
tend to be at least somewhat correlated with one another and move in concert, due to a degree
of dependence on the same general economic or market factors. This kind of common risk
potentially can be hedged, but cannot be reduced through diversification across counterparties.
The non-systematic, or idiosyncratic, component of CVA risk arises from factors that affect credit
spreads but are specific to an individual counterparty. In contrast to the systematic risk, the
idiosyncratic part of CVA risk can be reduced through diversification, as well as through hedging.
If a CVA portfolio is diversified to include many counterparties, it is not very likely that they would
all suffer idiosyncratic credit deterioration at the same time, so overall risk is reduced; gains on
some may offset losses on others.
The CVA capital calculation recognizes the difference between these two kinds of risk,
and treats them differently in the calculation. The first term in the square root in the capital
calculation reflects the systematic component of CVA variance:
2
(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
The exposures are weighted and summed before squaring. Holding risk weights constant,
spreading a given amount of exposure across more counterparties has no effect on this sum;
although there will be more individual terms in the summation, the sum will be the same, and thus
72

there are no gains from diversification. The second term in the square root reflects the
idiosyncratic CVA risk:
∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖
Here, because the weighted exposures are squared before summing, spreading a given amount
of exposure across more counterparties reduces the total, reflecting the beneficial, risk-reducing
effects of diversifying the idiosyncratic component of counterparty credit risk.
An alternative arrangement of the CVA capital calculation may provide additional intuition:

𝐾 =2.33√0.25(∑𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) + 0.75∑ (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
This form, which separates the factor of 0.5 from the rest of the systematic portion before it is
raised to the second power, highlights the fact that the CVA calculation can be viewed as
effectively a weighted average of two components, a systematic component with a weight of 25%,
and an idiosyncratic component with a weight of 75%. The 25% weight on the idiosyncratic
component is the theoretically correct weight if counterparties have a common systematic
correlation with the broader market of 50%. Note that this form is simply a mathematical
restatement of the capital calculation, yielding an identical answer for the stated case (that is,
single-name hedging only, no index hedges).
The portfolio-level calculation of CVA risk also recognizes that index hedges may reduce
systematic CVA risk. The calculation including index hedges is:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸 −∑𝑊 𝐻 𝐷𝐹 ) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
where Hind is the notional of an eligible purchased index hedge instrument that is used to hedge CVA risk,
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑑)
𝐷𝐹 = is the applicable supervisory discount factor, and M is the maturity of the index hedge.
𝑖𝑛𝑑 ind
0.05
Note that the effect of the index hedge appears only in the systematic component of CVA risk within the
square root. Also, note that there is no correlation-related coefficient associated with the index hedges,
analogous to the 0.5 or 0.75 coefficients for the single-name exposure terms. This reflects the fact that an
index CDS closely tracks the market, with a correlation expected tobe near perfect. The correct coefficient
on the index hedge terms in the model would be approximately 1.0, which is the reason for their omission.
The Standards also includes a version of the formula that more closely resembles the full
formula used in the BCBS framework:
2
2
𝐾=2.33√(∑0.5𝑊 𝑖(𝐸𝐴𝐷 𝑖𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 𝑖− 𝐻 𝑖×𝐷𝐹 𝐻) −∑𝑊

𝐷𝐹 𝑖𝑛𝑑) +∑0.75 (𝑊
𝑖
(𝐸𝐴𝐷 𝑖𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 𝑖− 𝐻 𝑖×𝐷𝐹 𝐻))
𝑖 𝑖𝑛𝑑 𝑖
In this form, the intermediate calculation of SNE is not used. However, the results of the
calculation are exactly the same as those produced by the formulation using SNE.
F. Maturity Calculation
When computing the maturity M for a netting set, banks are required to use a weighted
average, with notional values as the weights. For example, suppose a netting set with a particular
counterparty includes two exposures, a 2-year swap with a notional amount of 200, and a 3-year
swap with a notional amount of 400. The total notional value of the netting set is therefore
200+400=600. The weighted average maturity would be calculated as:
200 400
𝑀 =2×( )+3×( )=2.67
600 600

G. Risk Weights
Derivatives exposures and CVA hedges enter the CVA capital calculation with associated
risk weights that depend on the credit rating of the bank’s counterparties for the covered
exposures, or on the credit rating of the underlying entity for hedge instruments. In the case of
unrated counterparties or entities, banks should follow the approach applied by the Central Bank
for credit derivatives that reference unrated entities in the CCR Standards, treating them as BBB
rated unless the counterparty or entity has an elevated risk of default, in which case they should
be treated as BB rated.
The CVA Standards follows the BCBS framework in specifying an array of risk weights
