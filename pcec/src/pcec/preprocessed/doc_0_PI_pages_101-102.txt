The capital charge is the sum of four components calculated from amounts in each time band:
 A charge on the net short or long position in the whole trading book:
 A vertical disallowance charge:
It is a charge, which is levied on the matched position in each time band. This charges accounts
for basis risk and gap risk, which can arise because each time band includes different instruments
with different maturities. Gap risk, or interest mismatch risk, is the risk of losses due to interest
rate changes that arise when the periods over which assets and liabilities are priced, differs. This
charge is levied on the matched positionin each time band at:
 10% if the bank uses the maturity method
 5% of the bank uses the duration method
The matched position is the smaller absolute value of the long and short positions. For example:
if you have a long position of 1,200 and a short position of 700, the matched position is 700 (the
net open position is long 500).
 A horizontal disallowance charge:
It is a charge against correlation among the different time bands. It is allowed for correlation to
offset positions across different time bands.
There are three rounds of horizontal disallowance:
 Round 1 levies a charge on the matched position in each zone. The charge is:
o 40% for zone 1
o 30% for zone 2 and zone 3
 Round 2 levies a charge of 40% on the matched positions between adjacent zones. The
adjacent zones are:
o Zone 1 and zone 2
o Zone 2 and zone 3
 Round 3 levies a charge of 100% on the matched position between zone 1 and zone 3.
 Where applicable, a net charge for positions in options.
2. Specific Risk
Specific risk refers to changes in market prices specific to an instrument owing to factors
related to the issuer of that instrument.
Specific risk does not affect foreign exchange- and commodities-related instruments. This
is because changes in FX rates and commodities prices are dependent on general market
movements.

CBUAE Classification: Public
The charge for specific risk protects against price movements in a security owing to factors
related to the individual issuer, that is, price moves that are not initiated by the general market.
a) Offsetting
When specific risk is measured, offsetting between positions is restricted.
 Offsetting is only permitted for matched positions in an identical issue.
 Offsetting is not allowed between different issues, even if the issuer is the same. This is
because differences in coupon rates, liquidity, call features, and so on, mean that prices
may diverge in the short run.
b) Specific Risk – Capital Charge
Under the standardised approach, market risk exposures are categorised according to
external credit assessments (ratings) and based on those assessments a capital charge is
assigned. This broad methodology for calculating the specific risk capital charge was not changed
by Basel 2.5.
The capital charges assigned to those external credit assessments are similar to the credit
risk charges under the standardised approach to credit risk.
Categorisation of Securities
Consistent with other sections, a lower specific risk charge can be applied to government
paper denominated in the domestic currency and funded by the bank in the same currency. The
national discretion is limited to GCC Sovereigns. This use of national discretion aligns the Market
Risk Standards with the similar treatment under the credit risk standards. The Market Risk
Standard is also aligned to the Credit Risk Standard when it comes to the transition period
permitted for USD funded and denominated exposures of the individual Emirates.
Qualifying includes securities issued by public sector entities and multilateral development
banks, plus other securities that are rated with investment grades by two rating agencies. Unrated
securities can also be included, subject to supervisory approval (such as securities deemed to be
of comparable investment quality).
Other securities comprise of securities that do not meet the definition of government or the
definition of qualifying securities. This category receives the same risk charge as non-investment
grade borrowers under the standardised approach to credit risk. However, it is recognised that for
some high yielding debt instruments, an 8% specific risk charge may underestimate the specific
risk.
Calculating the Capital Requirement for Market and Credit Risk
The standards contain different processes for calculating the capital requirement for
market and credit risk. For credit risk, assets are first risk weighted (by multiplying them by a risk
weight) and then a capital requirement is applied. In contrast, for market risk, exposures are
simply multiplied by a specific risk capital charge. For an exposure with a given external credit
assessment (rating), the specific risk capital charge is the same as the capital requirement
calculated under the standardised approach for credit risk.

Specific Risk – Capital Charge for Positions Covered Under the Securitisation
Framework
Following the 2009 enhancements to the BCF, the specific risk of securitisation positions
held in the trading book are generally calculated in the same way as securitisation positions in the
banking book.
Specific risk – the capital charges for positions covered under the standardised approach
for securitisation exposures.
The default position for unrated securitisations can be thought of as a capital charge of
100 percent (that is, equivalent to a risk weight of 1250 percent where the capital charge is 8
percent).
Where the specific risk capital charge for an exposure is 100% such that capital is held for
the full value of the exposure, it may be excluded from the calculation of the capital charge for
general market risk. Forfurther details, please refer to the securitisation framework.
Treatment of Interest Rate Derivatives
The interest rate risk measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and
off-balance sheet instruments assigned to the trading book that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates.
The derivatives are converted into positions in the relevant underlying. These positions
are subject to the general market risk charges and, where applicable, the specific risk charges for
interest rate risk. The amounts reported should be the market value of the principal amount of the
underlying or notional underlying.
For instruments where the apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional
amount, banks will use the effective notional amount.
Interest rate derivatives include:
 forward rate agreements (FRAs)
 other forward contracts
 bond futures
 interest rate swaps
 cross currency swaps
 forward foreign exchange positions
 interest rate options

B. Equity Risk
Market risk can be influenced by changes in equity prices, that is, equity risk.
Equity risk is the risk that movement in equity prices will have a negative effect on the
value of equity positions. The capital charge for equity risk is the sum of the charges for general
and specific market risk.

The Central Bank sets out a minimum capital standard to cover the risk of equity positions
held in the trading book. It applies to long and short positions in all instruments that exhibit
behavior similar to equities, with the exception of non-convertible preference shares, which fall
under interest rate risk requirements.
1. Capital Charges for Equity Risk
To calculate the minimum capital charge for equity risk, you must calculate two separate
charges:
 A general market risk charge of 8% is applied to the net overall position.
 A specific risk charge of 8% is applied to the gross equity position. After offsetting long
and short positions in the same issue, a bank's gross equity position is the sum of the
absolute values of all long equity positions and all short equity positions.
Since banks may hold equities in different national markets, separate calculations for
general and specific risk must be carried out for eachof these markets.
Offsetting
Long and short positions in the same issue can be fully offset, resulting in a single net long or
short position.
2. Treatment of Equity Derivatives
Equity derivatives and off-balance-sheet positions that are affected by changes in equity
prices should be included in the measurement system, with the exception of certain options
positions. This includes futures and swaps on both individual equities and on stock indices.
Positions in these equity derivatives should be converted into notional positions in the
relevant underlying stock or portfolio of stocks. For example, stock index futures should be
reported as the marked-to-market value of the notional underlying equity portfolio. A stock index
future is an agreement to buy or sell a standard quantity of a specific stock index, on a recognised
exchange, at a price agreed between two parties, and with delivery to be executed on a
standardised future settlement date. As it is obviously not feasible to deliver an actual stock index,
stock index futures contracts are settled by cash, calculated with reference to the difference
between the purchase price and the level of the index at settlement.
An equity swap is an agreement between two counterparties to swap the returns on a
stock or a stock index for a stream of payments based on some other form of asset return. Often,
