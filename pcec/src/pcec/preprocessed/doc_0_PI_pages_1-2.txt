b. CBUAE Regulatory deductions:
i. Amount exceeding Large Exposure threshold: Any amount that is in violation of
Large Exposure regulation of notice 300/2013 shall be deducted from the capital.
Any amount deducted from CET1 under 5.1.4.5 of the BRF 95 due to a Large
Exposure violation of notice no.226/2018 may be excluded for the calculation of
risk weighted assets. However, amounts that are not deducted must be included
in risk weighted assets. Furthermore, any counterparty credit risk (under CR2a)
associated with such exposure must remain included in the calculation of risk
weighted asset.
ii. Loans to directors: The circular 83/2019 on Corporate Governance regulations for
Banks, under the article (6) “Transaction with Related parties” requires if the
transaction with the related parties are not provided on arm’s length basis, then on
general or case by case basis, deduct such exposure from capital. The deduction
should be reported under 5.1.4.5 of the BRF 95.
Capital Buffers - Countercyclical Buffer
17. The buffer for internationally active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers
deployed across all the jurisdictions to which it has credit exposures. The buffer that will apply to
each bank will reflect the geographic composition of its portfolio of credit exposures. When
considering the jurisdiction to which a private sector credit exposure relates, banks should use,
where possible, an ultimate risk basis; i.e. it should use the country where the guarantor of the
exposure resides, not where the exposure has been booked.
18. Banks will have to look at the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures
(including non-bank financial sector exposures) and calculate their countercyclical capital buffer
