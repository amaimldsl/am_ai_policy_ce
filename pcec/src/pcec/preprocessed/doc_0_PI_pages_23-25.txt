ministries, municipalities and other Emirates government departments. Banks have transition
period of 7 years from the date of implementation for exposures to Emirates Governments that
receive a 0% RW, if such exposures are denominated in AED or USD and funded in AED or USD.
Any claim on Emirates governments in a foreign currency other than USD should be risk weighted
according to the rating of the Emirate Government.

denominated in the domestic currency of that jurisdiction and funded in that currency, the same,
lower risk weight may be allocated to such claims (e.g. 0% assigned to the Government of Saudi
Arabia if the exposure is denominated and funded in SAR). This is limited only to GCC sovereign
exposures and this lower risk weight may be extended to the risk weighting of collateral and
guarantees (refer to section on credit risk mitigation).
All other exposures to sovereigns should be risk weighted according to the sovereign
rating even if the national supervisory authority adopts preferential risk weights.
B. Claims on Public Sector Entities (PSEs)
Non-Commercial PSEs
Non-Commercial PSEs include administrative bodies responsible to the UAE Federal
Government, to the Emirates Governments, or to local authorities and other non-commercial
undertakings owned by the Federal governments, Emirates Governments or local authorities.
These non-commercial PSEs do not have specific revenue- raising powers or specific institutional
arrangements the effect of which is to reduce their risks of default. The risk of non-commercial
PSE exposures is not equivalent to the risk of sovereign exposures and hence the treatment of
claims on sovereigns cannot be applied to non-commercial PSE. However, in exceptional cases,
a Non-Commercial PSE may receive the same treatment as its sovereign, if the entity has proven
formal arrangements in place to the effect that there is no distinction between the risk of the entity
and the risk of its sovereign. The Central Bank's GRE List would reflect this accordingly.
If the UAE borrower satisfies the criteria in paragraph 13, the risk weight shall be the same
as that for claims on banks. However, the preferential treatment for short-term claims on banks
may not be applied. In particular, unrated non-commercial PSE qualify for 50% risk weight. The
criteria are based on the principle that non-commercial PSEs qualify for lower risk weights
because they have significantly lower risk than a commercial company does. In addition, banks
are specifically required to ensure compliance with other aspects of the banking regulations when
lending to these entities, for example, but not limited to, the Central Bank large exposure
regulations.
The alternative criteria listed are to be applied in determining whether an entity qualifies
for treatment as a non-commercial PSE. The Central Bank provides a list (so-called GRE List) to
all the banks in the UAE which includes non-commercial PSEs.
i. Direct government (Federal or Emirate) ownership >50% directly or through a qualifying
PSE that itself is majority owned by government.
ii. An entity whose complete activities are functions of a government.
iii. Its services are of public benefit including when services are sold directly to the public
(e.g. electricity and water). The service provided should be of substantial public benefit
and the entity should have a monopolistic nature and there should be a significant
likelihood that the government would not let the entity go bankrupt.
iv. Not listed on any stock exchange.
v. Provides internal services to parent or sister companies only, and the parent company is
itself a non-commercial PSE.
vi. The function of the company is of a non-commercial nature and does not operate in a
competitive market.

vii. Does not operate overseas.
In the case of a UAE sovereign guarantee given to a non-commercial PSE, with the Central
Bank approval, the guarantee may be treated as eligible credit risk mitigation (CRM) to reduce
the exposure provided the bank ensures compliance with the entire minimum regulatory
requirements and operational requirements stated in the credit risk standard.
Government Related Entities (GRE)
These are commercial undertakings that are fully owned or more than 50% in ownership
by Federal governments, or by Emirates governments. As these entities function as a corporate
in the competitive markets even though the government is the major shareholder, Central Bank
requires such exposures to be classified under GRE and get the same treatment of claims on
corporate with the appropriate risk weights based on the credit rating of the entity.
All banks must comply with the latest version of the GRE list for classification and risk
weighting of entities. Banks that have information that would lead to the addition (or removal) of
an entity to (or from) the GRE list must submit such information to the Central Bank. All banks
must comply with the GRE list unless any addition or removal of entities is reflected in the GRE
list.
Banks Internal audit/compliance department should perform regular reviews to ensure
the PSE and GRE classification complies with the Central Bank GRE list.
C. Claims on multilateral development banks (MDBs)
Exposures to MDBs shall in general be treated similar to claim on banks, but without using
the preferential treatment for short term claims. However, highly rated MDBs, which meet certain
criteria specified below, are eligible for a preferential 0% risk weight.
i. Very high quality long-term issuer ratings, i.e. a majority of an MDB's external
assessments must be AAA;
ii. Shareholder structure is comprised of a significant proportion of sovereigns with long-
term issuer credit assessments of AA- or better, or the majority of the MDB's fund-
raising is in the form of paid-in equity/capital and there is little or no leverage;
iii. Strong shareholder support demonstrated by the amount of paid-in capital contributed
by the shareholders; the amount of further capital the MDBs have the right to call, if
required, to repay their liabilities; and continued capital contributions and new pledges
from sovereign shareholders;
iv. Adequate level of capital and liquidity (a case-by-case approach is necessary in order
to assess whether each MDB's capital and liquidity are adequate), and
v. Strict statutory lending requirements and conservative financial policies, which would
include among other conditions a structured approval process, internal
creditworthiness and risk concentration limits (per country, sector, and individual
exposure and credit category), large exposures approval by the board or a committee
of the board, fixed repayment schedules, effective monitoring of use of proceeds,
status review process, and rigorous assessment of risk and provisioning to loan loss
reserve.

MDBs currently eligible for 0% risk weight are the World Bank Group comprised of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation,
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Development Association,
the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the European
Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank,
the International Finance Facility for Immunisation and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
The list of MDBs is by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and can be found
on the website www.bis.org. All banks are required to refer to and comply with the BCBS list.
Whilst the BCBS evaluates the eligibility of the entities on a case-by-case basis, the Central Bank
has no role in the assessment and decision of entities being eligible for 0% risk weight.
D. Claims on Banks
The types of claims that fall under this asset class are claims not limited to those due from
banks, nostro accounts, certificates of deposit (CD) issued by banks, and repurchase agreements
(repos). A risk weight of 50% (long term) and 20% (short term) is applied to claims on unrated
banks. However, this treatment is subject to the provision that no claim on an unrated bank may
receive a risk weight lower than that applied to claims on its sovereign of incorporation.
Exposure to intra-group of the bank have to be risk weighted according to the external
rating of the counterparty entity (e.g. exposures to the head office shall receive the risk weight
according to the rating of the head office).
E. Claims on Securities Firms
In addition to providing loans to other banks in the interbank market, banks provide loans to
securities firms. The securities firms use these loans to fund the purchase of securities. Exposures
to these securities firms shall be treated as claims on banks if these firms are subject to prudential
standards and a level of supervision that is equivalent to those applicable to banks. Such
supervision must include at least both capital and liquidity requirements. Exposures to all other
securities firms that are not treated as claims on banks will be treated as exposures to corporates.
F. Claims on Corporates
For the purposes of calculating capital requirements, exposures to corporates include, but
are not limited to, exposures (loans, bonds, receivables, etc.) to incorporated entities,
associations, partnerships, proprietorships, trusts, funds and other entities with similar
characteristics, except those which qualify for one of the other exposure classes. The corporate
exposure class does not include exposures to individuals.
Claims on corporates may be risk- weighted based on the entity’s external credit rating
assessment. The Central Bank may increase the standard risk weight for unrated claims where it
judges that a higher risk weight is warranted by the overall default experience. As part of the
supervisory review process, the Central Bank may also consider whether the credit quality of
corporate claims held by banks warrants a risk weight higher than 100%.
G. Claims included in the Regulatory Retail Portfolios
To qualify for a 75% risk weight in the regulatory retail portfolio, claims must meet the four
