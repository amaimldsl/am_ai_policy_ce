approach?
A bank that intends to apply the comprehensive approach requires prior approval from the Central
Bank. Once approved and if the bank wishes to go back to simple approach, a bank requiresthe
Central Bank's approval again to go to the simple approach.

Bank A repos out cash of AED 1000 to a corporate with an external rating of AA. The corporate
provides collateral in the form of debt securities issued by a bank with an external rating of
AA. The debt securities have a remaining maturity of 7 years and a market value of AED 990.

Thehaircut for the transaction with other than 10 business days minimum holding
period, as indicated above, will have to be adjusted by scaling up or down the haircut for
10 business days as per the formula given below:

IV. Counterparty Credit Risk
I. Introduction
1. In March 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a new
approach for measurement of counterparty credit risk exposure associated with OTC derivatives,
exchange-traded derivatives, and long settlement transactions, the standardised approach for
CCR (SA-CCR). The approach in the Central Bank’s Standards for CCR closely follows the SA-
CCR as developed by theBCBS in all material areas of substance.
2. The BCBS developed the SA-CCR to replace the two previous non-internal model
methods, the Current Exposure Method (CEM) and the Standardized Method (SM). The SA-CCR
was designed to be more risk sensitive than CEM and SM. It accurately recognizes the effects of
collateralization and recognizes a benefit from over-collateralization. It also provides incentives
for centralized clearing of derivative transactions.
3. As is the case with the CEM, under the SA-CCR the exposure at default (EAD) is
calculated as the sum of two components: (i) replacement cost (RC), which reflects the current
value of the exposure adjusted for the effects of net collateral including thresholds, minimum
transfer amounts, and independent amounts; and (ii) potential future exposure (PFE), which
reflects the potential increase in exposure until the closure or replacement of the transactions.
The PFE portion consists of a multiplier that accounts for over-collateralization, and an aggregate
add-on derived from the summation of add-ons for each asset class (interest rate, foreign
exchange, credit, equity, and commodity), which in turn are calculated at the hedging set level.
II. Clarifications
A. Replacement Cost
4. Note that in mathematical terms, replacement cost for un-margined transactions is
calculated as:
𝑅𝐶 = max(𝑉 − 𝐶; 0)
where RC is replacement cost, V is the total current market value of all derivative contracts in the
netting set combined, and C is the net value of collateral for the netting set, after application of
relevant haircuts. (In the CCR Standards, the quantity V-C is referred to as the Net Current Value,
or NCV.)
5. For margined transactions, the calculation becomes:
𝑅𝐶 = max(𝑉 − 𝐶; 𝑇𝐻 + 𝑀𝑇𝐴 − 𝑁𝐼𝐶𝐴; 0)
where TH is the threshold level of variation that would require a transfer of collateral, MTA is the
minimum transfer amount of the collateral, and NICA is the Net Independent Collateral Amount
equal to the difference between the value of any independent collateral posted by a counterparty
and any independent collateral posted by the bank for that counterparty, excluding any collateral
that the bank has posted to a segregated, bankruptcy remote account.

6. When determining the RC component of a netting set, the netting contract must not contain
any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty
to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if
the defaulting party is a net creditor.
B. Netting
7. The Standards requires that a bank should apply netting only when it can satisfy the
Central Bank that netting is appropriate, according to the specific requirements established in the
Standards. Banks should recognize that this requirement would likely be difficult to meet in the
case of trades conducted in jurisdictions lacking clear legal recognition of netting, which at present
is the case in the UAE.
8. If netting is not recognized, then netting sets still should be used for the calculation.
However, since each netting set must contain only trades that can be netted, each netting set is
likely to consist of a single transaction. The calculations of EAD can still be performed, although
they simplify considerably.
9. Note that there may be more than one netting set for a given counterparty. In that case,
the CCR calculations should be performed for each netting set individually. The individual netting
set calculations can be aggregated to the counterparty level for reporting or other purposes.
C. PFE Multiplier
10. For the multiplier of the PFE component, when the collateral held is less than the net
market value of the derivative contracts (“under-collateralization”), the current replacement cost
is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full value of
the aggregate add-on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of the
derivative contracts (“over-collateralization”), the current replacement cost is zero and the
multiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-
on).
D. Supervisory Duration
11. The Supervisory Duration calculation required in the Standards is in effect the present
value of a continuous-time annuity of unit nominal value, discounted at a rate of 5%. The implied
annuity is received between dates S and E (the start date and the end date, respectively), and
the present value is taken to the current date.
12. For interest rate and credit derivatives, the supervisory measure of duration depends on
each transaction’s start date S and end date E. The following Table presents example
transactions and illustrates the values of S and E, expressed in years, which would be associated
with each transaction, together with the maturity M of the transaction.

13. Note there is a distinction between the period spanned by the underlying transaction and
the remaining maturity of the derivative contract. For example, a European interest rate swaption
with expiry of 1 year and the term of the underlying swap of 5 years has S=1 year and E=6 years.
An interest rate swap, or an index CDS, maturing in 10 years has S=0 years and E=10 years. The
parameters S and E are only used for interest rate derivatives and credit-related derivatives.
E. Aggregation of Maturity Category Effective Notional Amounts
14. The Standards allows banks to choose between two options for aggregating the effective
notional amounts that are calculated for each maturity category for interest rate derivatives. The
primary formula is thefollowing:
√𝐷12+𝐷22+𝐷32+1.4×(𝐷1×𝐷2)+1.4×(𝐷2×𝐷3)+0.6×(𝐷1×𝐷3)
15. In this formula, D1 is the effective notional amount for maturity category 1, D2 is the
effective notional amount for maturity category 2, and D3 is the effective notional amount for
maturity category 3. As defined in the Standards, maturity category 1 is less than one year,
