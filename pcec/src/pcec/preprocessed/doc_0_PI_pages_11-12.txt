Appendix 4: Minority interest illustrative example
This Appendix illustrates the treatment of minority interest and other capital issued out of
subsidiaries to third parties, which is set out in section 2.7 of the Tier Capital Supply Standard
(Paragraph 35 to 41).
A banking group consists of two legal entities that are both banks. Bank P is the parent, Bank S
is the subsidiary, and their unconsolidated balance sheets are set out below
Amount Amount
Bank P Balance sheet Bank S Balance sheet
(AED) (AED)
Assets Assets
Loan to customers 100 Loan to customers 150
Investment in CET 1 of Bank S 7
Investment in AT1 of Bank S 4
Investment in T2 of Bank S 2
Total Assets 113 Total Assets 150
Liabilities and Equities Liabilities and Equities
Depositors 70 Depositors 127
Common Equity (CET1) 26 Common Equity (CET1) 10
Additional Tier1 (AT1) 7 Additional Tier1 (AT1) 5
Tier 2 10 Tier 2 8
Total Liabilities and Equities 113 Total Liabilities and Equities 150
The balance sheet of Bank P shows that in addition to its loans to customers, it owns 70% of the
common shares of Bank S, 80% of the Additional Tier 1 of Bank S and 25% of the Tier 2 capital
of Bank S. The ownership of the capital of Bank S is therefore as follows:
Capital issued by Bank S
Amount Issued to Amount Issued
Total
Parent to third party
Common Equity (CET1) 7 3 10
Additional Tier1 (AT1) 4 1 5
Tier 1 11 4 15
Tier 2 2 6 8

The consolidated balance sheet of the banking group is set out below:
Consolidated Balance sheet of Bank P
Assets Amount (AED)
Loan to customers 250
Total Assets 250
Liabilities and Equities
Depositors 197
Common Equity (CET1) 26

Tier 2 10
Minority Interest
Common Equity (CET1) 3
Additional Tier1 (AT1) 1
Tier 2 6
Liabilities and Equities 250
For illustrative purposes, Bank S is assumed to have risk-weighted assets of 100. In this example,
the minimum capital requirements of Bank S and the subsidiaryâ€™s contribution to the consolidated
requirements are the same since Bank S does not have any loans to Bank P. This means that it
is subject to the following minimum plus capital conservation buffer requirements and has the
following surplus capital:
