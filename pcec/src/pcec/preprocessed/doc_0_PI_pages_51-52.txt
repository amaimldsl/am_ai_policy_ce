V. Illustrations of EAD Calculations
A. Illustration 1
Consider a netting set with three interest rates derivatives: two fixed versus floating interest rate
swaps and one purchased physically settled European swaption. The table below summarizes
the relevant contractual terms of the three derivatives. All notional amounts and market values in
the table are given in USD. We also know that this netting set is not subject to a margin agreement
and there is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception.
Trade # Nature Residual Base Notional Pay Receive Market value
maturity currency (thousands) Leg (*) Leg (*) (thousands)
1 Interest rate 10 years USD 10,000 Fixed Floating 30
swap
2 Interest rate 4 years USD 10,000 Floating Fixed -20
swap
3 European 1 into 10 years EUR 5,000 Floating Fixed 50
swaption
(*) For the swaption, the legs are those of the underlying swap.
The EAD for un-margined netting sets is given by:
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE)
1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives’ market values at the reference date. Thus, using the market values
indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {30 - 20 + 50; 0} = 60
Since V-C is positive (equal to V of 60,000), the value of the multiplier is 1, as explained in the
Standards.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
All the transactions in the netting set belong to the interest rate asset class. So the Add-on for
interest rate class must be calculated as well as the multiplier since
PFE = multiplier × Add-on
agg
For the calculation of the interest rate add-on, the three trades must be assigned to a hedging set
(based on the currency) and to a maturity category (based on the end date of the transaction). In
this example, the netting set is comprised of two hedging sets, since the trades refer to interest
rates denominated in two different currencies (USD and EUR). Within hedging set “USD”, Trade
1 falls into the third maturity category (>5 years) and Trade 2 falls into the second maturity
category (1-5 years). Trade 3 falls into the third maturity category (>5 years) of hedgingset “EUR”.

The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation:
Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate supervisory duration
Calculate trade-level adjusted notional as trade
notional (in domestic currency) × supervisory
duration
Effective notional for each maturity category =
Σ(trade-level adjusted notional × supervisory delta
× maturity factor), with full offsetting for each of the
three maturity categories, in each hedging set
(that is, same currency)
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each maturity category in a hedging set
(that is, same currency) = Effective Notional
Amount for maturity category × interest rate
supervisory factor
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Add-on for each hedging set = Σ(Add-ons for
maturity categories), aggregating across maturity
categories for a hedging set. One hedging set for
each currency.
4. Aggregate Simple summation of the add-ons for the different
hedging sets
Calculate Effective Notional Amount
The adjusted notional of each trade is calculated by multiplying the notional amount by the
calculated supervisory duration SD as defined in the Standards.
d = Trade Notional × SD = Trade Notional × (exp(-0.05×S) – exp(-0.05 × E)) / 0.05

Calculate Maturity Category Effective Notional
A supervisory delta is assigned to each trade in accordance with the Standards. In particular:
 Trade 1 is long in the primary risk factor (the reference floating rate) and is not an
option so the supervisory delta is equal to 1.
 Trade 2 is short in the primary risk factor and is not an option; thus, the supervisory
delta is equal to -1.
 Trade 3 is an option to enter into an interest rate swap that is short in the primary risk
factor and therefore is treated as a purchased put option. As such, the supervisory
delta is determined by applying the relevant formula using 50% as the supervisory
option volatility and 1 (year) as the option exercise date. Assume that the underlying
price (the appropriate forward swap rate) is 6% and the strike price (the swaption’s
fixed rate) is 5%.
The trade-level supervisory delta is therefore:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short(forward and swap)
ln(0.06
)+0.5∗(0.5)2∗1
0.05
−Φ(− )=−0.27
Trade 3 0.5∗√1 purchased put option
The Maturity Factor MF is 1 for all the trades since they are un-margined and have remaining
maturities in excess of one year.
Based on the maturity categories, the Effective Notional D for the USE and EUR hedging sets at
the level of the maturity categories are as shown in the table below:
Maturity category-level Effective

HS 2 (EUR) 3 37,427,961 -0.27 1 -10,105,550
In particular:
Hedging set USD, time bucket 3: D = 1 * 78,693,868 * 1 = 78,693,868
Hedging set USD, time bucket 2: D = -1 * 36,253,849 * 1 = -36,253,849

The add-on must be calculated for each hedging set.
For the USD hedging set there is partial offset between the two USD trades:
Effective notional(IR) [D22 + D32 + 1.4 x D2 x D3]1/2
USD =
= [(-36,253,849)2 + 78,693,8682 + 1.4 × (-36,253,849) × 78,693,868]1/2
= 59,269,963
For the Hedging set EUR there is only one trade (and one maturity category):
