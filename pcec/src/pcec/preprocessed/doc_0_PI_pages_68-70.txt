portfolio, and yet that CDS would not be eligible to offset the single-name CVA exposure within
the CVA calculation if that CDS was not originated or acquired as part of the bank’s process to
manage CVA risk for that particular counterparty.
To clearly demonstrate intent to manage CVA risk, the bank should have a documented
CVArisk management process or program, so that any CVA hedging transaction is demonstrably
consistent with the design and operation of that program, was entered into with the intent to
mitigate the counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk, and continues to be managed by
the bank in a manner consistent with that intent. The Central Bank expects that any bank wishing
to recognize the benefits of hedges in CVA capital calculations will maintain policies and
procedures to govern this process. If the Central Bank concludes that a bank’s CVA hedging
policies and procedures are inadequate, the Central Bank may limit the bank’s ability to recognize
hedges in CVA capital calculations.
Another key principle for CVA hedging is that risk mitigation should transfer risk to third
parties external to the bank. Some banks use internal transactions to transfer risk between
different desks or business units within the bank as part of a broader risk management program,
with these transactions typically subject to some type of internal transfer pricing mechanism. Such
transactions are permissible and can be a valid component of the management of CVA risk within
a bank, but the risk ultimately should be transferred out of the bank, which generally requires a
corresponding external transaction to reduce CVA risk.

D. CVA Capital Concept
The standardised approach for calculation of CVA capital is a form of a value-at-risk
calculation, an approach commonly used to set capital requirements. Changes in CVA can be
viewed as following some distribution, such as the normal distribution illustrated in Figure 2.
Conceptually, the general approach to CVA capital is to estimate a level of CVA losses that should
be expected to be exceeded no more than a given percentage of the time. The CVA capital
calculation reflects a value-at-risk calculation with a one-year, 99% confidence level for CVA risk.
Assuming a normal distribution (or equivalently, a log-normal distribution for the underlying risk
factors), losses can be expected to be within 2.33 standard deviations of the mean 99% of the
time. That concept is illustrated in Figure 2, where the 1% negative tail of the distribution has been
highlighted (in this case,  is the standard deviation).
Figure 2
Accordingly, the general form of the CVA capital calculation depends on the standard
deviation of CVA losses:
CVA capital = 2.33 × 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
= 2.33 × √𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐶𝑉𝐴
The normality assumption, together with a desired 99% confidence level, is the reason for the
inclusion of a 2.33 multiplication factor in the CVA capital formula. Other elements of the CVA
capital calculation reflect a theoretical approximation of the variance of changes in CVA.
E. CVA Capital Formula
In the BCBS publication of Basel III, banks using the standardised approach to calculate
CVA capital are to use the following formula:
The Central Bank’s CVA calculation, while based directly on the BCBS formula and
producing the same result, uses different (generally simpler) notation. The nature of, and
motivation for, the main notational differences are explained in this section.

A minor difference in notation is the omission of the multiplicative term “√ℎ” from the BCBS
formulation. This term was included by the BCBS to allow the CVA capital calculation to be
adjusted to an appropriate prudential horizon. However, in the ultimate calibration of the CVA
calculation the horizon h was established at one year, and hence h=1. Since the square root of 1
is also 1, and the term is a multiplicative factor, it has no impact on the resulting capital. Some
other jurisdictions have recognized this fact, and have omitted the √ℎ from the CVA calculation
for simplicity in their published capital regulations. The Central Bank has followed this approach.
Another difference between the BCBS notation and thepresentation of the formula in the
Standards is the concept of “single-name exposure” or SNE. Under the Standards, a bank
calculates SNE for each counterparty as:
𝑆𝑁𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙×𝐷𝐹 − 𝐻 ×𝐷𝐹
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝐻
In this calculation, 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the bank’s total exposure to counterparty “i” across all derivatives
netting sets plus the co𝑖 unterparty exposure measure arising from SFTs with that counterparty,
and H is the total notional of eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. (The symbol
i
H is used in place of B in the BCBS formula, an appropriate adjustment of notation since it reflects
hedge instruments. DF is a supervisory discount factor, described further below.) In effect, the
discounted value of the individual counterparty exposure is offset by the discounted value of
eligible single-name CVA hedges for that counterparty. The Central Bank regards SNE as a useful
concept, because it reflects single-name exposure net of hedges. Its use also simplifies
presentation of the CVA capital formulas.
The form of the supervisory discount factor DF in the Standards differs somewhat from
the corresponding BCBS notation. Specifically, DF is defined in the CVA Standards as:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
𝐷𝐹 =
0.05
This form of DF is in effect the continuous-time present value of an M-period annuity of one AED
discounted at a rate of 5%.

In contrast, the BCBS formula includes the maturity term M directly in the denominator of
the supervisory discount factor, as follows:
(1−𝑒−0.05𝑀)
0.05×𝑀
However, the BCBS formula for CVA capital also multiplies by M as part of the CVA capital
calculation. As a result of that multiplication, the M in the denominator of the discount factor is
cancelled out, making the overall result the same as that provided by DF in the Standards. The
formulation in the BCBS text was designed to accommodate the fact that banks using internal
models incorporate discounting into the calculation of counterparty exposure, and those banks
are required to set the BCBS supervisory discount factor to one, while retaining the multiplication
by M. However, since internal-model approaches are not used for regulatory capital purposes in
the UAE, this flexibility is not needed, and the simpler version of the calculation has been specified
in the Standards. If for operational or other reasons a bank finds using the Basel formulation of
the discount factor more convenient, its use is acceptable, provided the bank also multiplies the
resulting discount factor by M.
If the bank uses single-name hedging only, the bank aggregates SNE across
counterparties to calculate CVA capital using the following formula:
2
𝐾 =2.33√(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸) +∑0.75 (𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)2
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝑖 𝑖
where K is CVA capital, and Wi is the risk weight applicable to counterparty “i” taken from the
risk- weight table in the Standards.
An important insight is that CVA risk has both a systematic component and an idiosyncratic
component. The systematic component reflects the fact that credit risks of different counterparties
tend to be at least somewhat correlated with one another and move in concert, due to a degree
of dependence on the same general economic or market factors. This kind of common risk
potentially can be hedged, but cannot be reduced through diversification across counterparties.
The non-systematic, or idiosyncratic, component of CVA risk arises from factors that affect credit
spreads but are specific to an individual counterparty. In contrast to the systematic risk, the
idiosyncratic part of CVA risk can be reduced through diversification, as well as through hedging.
If a CVA portfolio is diversified to include many counterparties, it is not very likely that they would
all suffer idiosyncratic credit deterioration at the same time, so overall risk is reduced; gains on
some may offset losses on others.
The CVA capital calculation recognizes the difference between these two kinds of risk,
and treats them differently in the calculation. The first term in the square root in the capital
calculation reflects the systematic component of CVA variance:

(∑0.5 𝑊 𝑆𝑁𝐸)

The exposures are weighted and summed before squaring. Holding risk weights constant,
spreading a given amount of exposure across more counterparties has no effect on this sum;
although there will be more individual terms in the summation, the sum will be the same, and thus
