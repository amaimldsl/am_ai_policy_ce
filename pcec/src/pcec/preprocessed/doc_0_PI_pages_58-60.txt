1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives’ market values at the reference date, provided that value is positive. Thus,
using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {100 - 30 - 50; 0} = 20
The replacement cost is positive and there is no exchange of collateral (so the bank has not
received excess collateral), which means the multiplier will be equal to 1.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation, for each of
the four commodity hedging sets with non-zero exposure:

Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate trade-level adjusted notional = current
price × number of units referenced by derivative
Calculate trade-level effective notional amount =
trade-level adjusted notional × supervisory delta
× maturity factor
Calculate effective notional for each commodity-
type = Σ(trade-level effective notional) for trades
referencing the same commodity type, with full
offsetting in commodity type
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each commodity type in a hedging set
= Commodity-type Effective Notional Amount ×
Supervisory Factor
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Commodity-type add-ons are divided into
systematic and idiosyncratic components
weighted by the correlation factor
4. Aggregate Aggregationof commodity-type add-ons with full
offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting in the idiosyncratic component

The appropriate supervisory delta must be assigned to each trade:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short (forward & swap)
Trade 3 1 linear, long (forward & swap)
Since the remaining maturity of Trade 1 is less than a year, at nine months (approximately 187
business days), and the trade is un-margined, its maturity factor is scaled down by the square
root of 187/250 in accordance with the requirements of the Standards. On the other hand, the
maturity factor is 1 for Trade 2 and for Trade 3, since the remaining maturity of those two trades
is greater than one year and they are un-margined.
The trade-level effective notional is equal to the adjusted notional times the supervisory delta
times the maturity factor. The basic difference between the WTI and Brent forward contracts
effectively is ignored since they belong to the same commodity type, namely “Crude Oil” within
the “Energy” hedging set, thus allowing for full offsetting. (In contrast, if one of the two forward
contracts were on a different commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set, such as natural
gas, with the other on crude oil, then only partial offsetting would have been allowed between the
two trades.) Therefore, Trade 1 and Trade 2 can be aggregated into a single effective notional,
taking into account each trade’s supervisory delta and maturity factor.

Supervisory Factor
For each commodity-type in a hedging set, the effective notional amount must be multiplied by
the correct Supervisory Factor (SF).As described in the Standards, the Supervisory Factor for

both the Crude Oil commodity type in the Energy hedging set and the Silver commodity type in
the Metals hedging set is SF=18%.
Thus, the add-on by hedging set and commodity type is as follows:

Supervisory Correlation Parameters
The commodity-type add-ons in a hedging set aredecomposed into systematic and idiosyncratic
components. The commodity subclass correlations parameters are as stated in the Standards, in
this case 40% for commodities.
Thus, the hedging set level add-ons are calculated for each commodity hedging set:
Add­on(COM) = [( Σ

Metals Silver 40% 1,800 (720)2 0.84 0.84 × (1,800)2 1,800
However, in this example, since only one commodity type within the “Energy” hedging set is
populated (i.e. all other commodity types within that hedging set have a zero add-on), the resulting
add-on for the hedging set is the same as the add-on for the commodity type. This calculation
shows that when there is only one commodity type within a commodity hedging set, the hedging-
set add-on is equal to the absolute value of the commodity-type add-on. (The same comment
applies to the commodity type “Silver” in the “Metals” hedging set.)
Add-on Aggregation
Aggregation of commodity-type add-ons uses full offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component in each hedging set. As noted earlier, in this
example there is only one commodity type per hedging set, which means no offsetting benefits.
Computing the simple summation of absolute values of add-ons for the hedging sets:
Add-on = Σ Add-on

Add-On = 2,043 + 1,800 = 3,843
