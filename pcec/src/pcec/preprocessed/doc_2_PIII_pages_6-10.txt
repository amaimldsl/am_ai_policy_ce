templates, banks will need to consider carefully how widely the disclosure requirement should
apply. If a bank considers that the information requested in a template or table would not be
meaningful to users, for example because the exposures and RWA amounts are deemed
immaterial, it may choose not to disclose part or all of the information requested. In such
circumstances, however, the bank will be required to explain in a narrative commentary why it
considers such information not to be meaningful to users. It should describe the portfolios
excluded from the disclosure requirement and the aggregate total RWAs those portfolios
represent.
Templates with a fixed format
17. Where the format of a template is described as fixed, banks should complete the fields in
accordance with the instructions given.
18. If a row/column is not considered to be relevant to a bank’s activities the bank may delete
the specific row/column from the template, but the numbering of the subsequent rows and
columns should not be altered. Banks may add extra rows and extra columns to fixed format
templates if they wish to provide additional detail to a disclosure requirement by adding sub-rows
185

CBUAE Classification: Public
or columns, but the numbering of prescribed rows and columns in the template should not be
altered.
Templates/tables with a flexible format
19. Where the format of a template is described as flexible, banks may present the required
information either in the format provided in this guidance or in one that better suits the bank. The
format for the presentation of qualitative information in tables is not prescribed.
20. However, where a customized presentation of the information is used, the bank should
provide information comparable with that required in the disclosure requirement (i.e. at a similar
level of granularity as if the template/table were completed as presented in this document).
Signposting
21. Banks may disclose in a document separate from their Pillar 3 report (e.g. in a bank’s
annual report or through published regulatory reporting) the templates/tables with a flexible
format, and the fixed format templates where the criteria in paragraph 22 are met. In such
circumstances, the specific Pillar 3 table(s) may form a section in a bank’s financial reporting, but
the full table will be needed to be disclosed in the Pillar 3 tables separately as well.
22. The disclosure requirements for templates with a fixed format can be disclosed by banks
in a separate document other than the Pillar 3 report provided all of the following criteria are met:
• the information contained in the signposted document is equivalent in terms of presentation and
content to that required in the fixed template and allows users to make meaningful comparisons
with information provided by banks disclosing the fixed format templates;
• the information contained in the signposted document is based on the same scope of
consolidation as the one used in the disclosure requirement;
• the disclosure in the signposted document is mandatory.
Banks should note that although signposting may be allowed in the annual report, the bank would
still need to disclose this table separately in the Pillar 3 Disclosure along with all other tables
mentioned in paragraph 27 below.
23. Banks can only make use of signposting to another document if the level of assurance on
the reliability of data in the separate document are equivalent to, or greater than, the internal
assurance level required for the Pillar 3 report (see sections on reporting and assurance of Pillar
3 data above).
Qualitative narrative to accompany the disclosure requirements
24. Banks are expected to supplement the quantitative information provided in both fixed and
flexible templates with a narrative commentary to explain at least any significant changes between
reporting periods and any other issues that management considers to be of interest to market
participants. The form taken by this additional narrative is at the bank’s discretion.
25. Disclosure of additional quantitative and qualitative information will provide market
participants with a broader picture of a bank´s risk position and promote market discipline.
26. Additional voluntary risk disclosures allow banks to present information relevant to their
business model that may not be adequately captured by the standardised requirements.
Additional quantitative information that banks choose to disclose should provide sufficient
meaningful information to enable market participants to understand and analyze any figures
provided. It should also be accompanied by a qualitative discussion. Any additional disclosure
should comply with the five guiding principles set out in paragraph 14 above.

III. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Question 1: One or more senior officers of a bank, ideally at boardlevel or equivalent,
should attest in writing that Pillar 3 disclosures have been prepared in accordance
with the board-agreed internal control processes. For banks of foreign branches, is
Country Manager or CFO at Head office attestation sufficient?
For local banks and large foreign banks, Board member attestation will be expected. For
smaller foreign bank branches, Country Manager/GM will be sufficient
Question 2: There are requirements on the Pillar III disclosure that is dependent on
the BASEL returns (BRF 95), in relation to this, the submission that mentions 6 weeks
after the end of the relevant quarter starts from the BASEL quarter reporting deadline
or actual quarter end?
Pillar 3 disclosure submission will be 6 weeks after the quarter end date. For example,
December quarter submission will be 6 weeks from December 31st and not 6 weeks from
January 31st. Since the BRF95 should mandatorily be submitted by banks within 4 weeks
from quarter end, the bank still has additional 2 weeks to complete the Pillar 3 disclosures
based on BRF95.
Question 3: Pillar 3 applies to all banks in the UAE at the top consolidated level for
local banks... Please clarify in case of subsidiary of a bank, whether revised pillar 3
disclosures will be required to be prepared at consolidated Group level or stand-alone
level?
Bank subsidiaries will be consolidated at stand-alone subsidiary level and the group bank
will be consolidated at the stand-alone of the group bank only without the bank’s subsidiary
data.
Question 4: Pillar 3 disclosures can be presented in a separate report; however, Can
it be signposted to the audited financial statements?
Signposting is allowed if the bank chooses to use the same template in their audited financial
statements but a separate reporting template needs to be prepared as per Pillar 3 templates
which is mandatory and cannot be omitted from the Pillar 3 tables.
Question 5: If any section/ table of Template is not applicable to the Bank (i.e. DSIBs,
Securitisation), shall the Bank exclude this section/ table completely irrespective of
type of table.
Yes, banks can exclude the tables/templates not pertaining to the bank, for example DSIB
and Securitisation
Question 6: Banks should also have a formal board-approved disclosure policy for
Pillar 3 information that sets out the internal controls and procedures for disclosure
of such information. Should this formal Disclosure policy still be submitted to Central
Bank along with ICAAP or it shall only be published / disclosed as mentioned?
The formal disclosure policy should not be submitted but should be available on request by
Central Bank of UAE.
Question 7: Will it be sufficient to publish Basel 3 disclosures on its investor relations
page on the bank’s website without any physical printouts?
Banks should publish their Pillar 3 report in a stand-alone document on the bank’s UAE-
specific website. This can be anywhere on the website but it needs to be clearly visible and
easily available for all stakeholders. Banks which do not have a UAE-Specific website should
create a website specific to UAE so that all stakeholders can have access to the Pillar 3
disclosures of the bank.
Question 8: For REM1 template, is Central Bank expecting the Bank to report overseas
earnings or only the locally paid compensation? Are deferrals awarded in the current
