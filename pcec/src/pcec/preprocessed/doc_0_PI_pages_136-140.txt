VII. Appendix
Further Options under the ASA – Option 1
Under the ASA Option 1, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking using a common
beta of 15%, instead of 12% and 15%, respectively, as prescribed under the Standardised
Approach (SA). For the other six business lines, the relevant beta factors as prescribed under the
SA are used. The exposure indicator remains the volume of loans and advances for commercial
and retail banking and gross income for the other six business lines.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 2
Under Option 2, banks may maintain the SA beta factors of 12% and 15% for retail and
commercial banking and aggregate the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The
volume of loans and advances is used as the exposure indicator for commercial and retail
banking. Gross income is used for the other six business lines. Banks undertaking predominantly
traditional banking activities, such as retail and commercial banking, and unable to segregate
their grossincome according to businesslines may find it useful to adopt this option.
Further Options under the ASA – Option 3
Under Option 3, banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking with a beta factor of 15%
and the other six business lines with a beta factor of 18%. The volume of loans and advances is
used as the exposure indicator for retail banking and commercial banking. Gross income is used
for the other six business lines.

X. External Credit Assessment Institutions
I. Introduction and Scope
1. Banks are required to use external ratings to determine risk weights for certain types of
exposures. However, only external ratings provided by External Credit Assessment Institutions
(ECAIs) that have been recognized as eligible for that purpose by the Central Bank may be used.
This Guidance describes the specific requirements for the recognition of eligible ECAIs, together
with certain other aspects of the use of ratings within the Central Bank’s capital adequacy
framework. Note that additional requirements related to the use of ratings in capital requirements
for securitisation are provided in the Central Bank’s Standards on Required Capital for
Securitisation Exposures.
2. The Guidance is based closely on requirements of the framework for capital adequacy
developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), specifically the requirements
articulated by the BCBS in International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards: A Revised Framework (comprehensive version June 2006), and the revisions from
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, December
2010 (rev June 2011).
II. Eligibility Criteria
3. ECAIs may beconsidered eligible for recognition if they meet the criteria articulated in this
section. The Central Bank also takes into account the criteria and conditions provided in the
IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies (IOSCO CRA Code) when
determining ECAI eligibility.
4. The Central Bank’s eligibility determination for each ECAI applies only with respect to the
types of claims for which the eligibility criteria have been met by that ECAI.
A. Objectivity
5. ECAI’s should have a methodology for assigning credit ratings that is rigorous and
systematic, and is subject to validation based on historical experience. Ratings assessments
should be based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. Moreover,
assessments must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition.
To establish that an ECAI fulfils this primary component of eligibility criteria, it must demonstrate
that it meets the following minimum standards:
(i) The ECAI has established rating definitions, criteria, and methodologies, and apply
them consistently;
(ii) The ECAI should have a robust procedure of rating assignment based on published
information, market data, interviews with management, and/or other sources of
information that provide a sound basis for purposes of assigning the ratings;
(iii) When assigning risk ratings, the ECAI should take into account all major features of
credit quality that are relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology, and should
ensure that the ratings are assigned taking into account all risk factors of the rated
entity or issue relevant under the ECAI’s applicable methodology;

(iv) The ECAI should demonstrate that rating methodologies are subject to quantitative
back testing. For this purpose, the ECAI should calculate and publish default studies,
recovery studies, rating transition matrices, or other analyses as relevant to the
ECAI’s rating methodology. The analysis should reflect a definition of default that is
consistent with international standards, subject to possible adjustments to take into
account local practices or institutional or market conditions;
(v) The rating methodology for each market segment, including rigorous back testing,
must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years;
(vi) All rating decisions should be made based on the ECAI’s established criteria and
methodologies, subject to documented variations approved in accordance with the
ECAI’s procedures;
(vii) The ECAI should have a mechanism to review its procedures and methodologies to
adapt them to a potentially changing environment; and
(viii) The ECAI should maintain adequate systems and internal records to support its
assigned ratings.
B. Independence
6. The ECAI should be free from any economic or external political pressures that may
influence its credit ratings. In particular, an ECAI should not delay or refrain from taking a rating
action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise). The independence of an
ECAI shall be assessed on the basis of the following five parameters:
(i) Ownership: The ownership structure should not be such that it could jeopardize the
objectivity of the rating process. For example, the owners should not hold 10 percent
or more of the equity of any entity rated by the ECAI.
(ii) Organizational Structure and Corporate Governance: The ECAI should
demonstrate that its organizational structure minimizes the scope for external
influences to influence the rating process inappropriately. The ECAI should have in
place effective corporate governance that safeguards the independence of its credit
ratings, promotes integrity, and ensures that internal disagreements over ratings are
resolved in ways that do not compromise the overall effectiveness of the rating
process.
(iii) Financial Resources: The ECAI must demonstrate that its business is financially
viable and is able to sustain any commercial pressure that might be exerted by
external entities, including the entities being rated. The ECAI’s financial position
should not depend significantly on the provision of other services to the rated entities.
(iv) External Conflict of Interest: The credit rating process of the ECAI should have the
ability to withstand external pressures. The ECAI should demonstrate that it is free
from any type of external conflicts of interest, or that conflicts of interest are disclosed
and managed.
(v) Separation: An ECAI should separate its rating business operationally, legally, and
if practicable, physically from its other business operations that may present a
conflict of interest, such as advisory services.

C. International Access and Transparency
7. The individual ratings, the key elements underlying the ratings, and whether the issuer
participated in the rating process should be information that is publicly available on a non-selective
basis.
8. In order to promote transparency and enable stakeholders to make decisions about the
appropriateness of its credit rating methods, an ECAI should disclose sufficient information (e.g.,
rating definition, methods of arriving at the rating, rating process, time horizon of the rating, and
the surveillance and review procedure) to facilitate such decisions. The ECAI’s general
procedures, methodologies, and assumptions for arriving at ratings should be publicly available.
D. Disclosure
9. A rating should be disclosed as soon as practicably possible after issuance. When
disclosing a rating, the information should be clearly worded, and should indicate the nature of
the rating and relevant limitations, while providing appropriate warning to users of the potential
danger of unduly relying on the rating to make investment or other decisions.
10. To promote transparency and market discipline, an ECAI should demonstrate that it
provides access to information that enables stakeholders to make decisions about the
appropriateness of ratings for the intended use or uses. At a minimum, the ECAI is expected to
make public the following information:
 Code of conduct;
 Definition of default;
 The time horizons reflected in ratings;
 Rating definitions;
 Rating methods;
 Actual default rates experienced in each rating category;
 Rating transition matrices;
 Whether particular ratings are solicited or unsolicited;
 The date of last review and update of ratings;
 The general nature of compensation arrangements with rated entities; and
 Any actual or potential conflicts of interest.
11. At a minimum, the following conflict-of-interest situations and their influence on the ECAI’s
credit rating methodologies or credit rating actions must be disclosed:
(i) The ECAI is being paid to issue a credit rating by a rated entity or by the obligor,
originator, underwriter, or arranger of a rated obligation;
(ii) The ECAI is being paid by subscribers with a financial interest that could be affected
by a credit rating action of the ECAI;
