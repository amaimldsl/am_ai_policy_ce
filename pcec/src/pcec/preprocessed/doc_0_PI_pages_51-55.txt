The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation:
Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate supervisory duration
Calculate trade-level adjusted notional as trade
notional (in domestic currency) × supervisory
duration
Effective notional for each maturity category =
Σ(trade-level adjusted notional × supervisory delta
× maturity factor), with full offsetting for each of the
three maturity categories, in each hedging set
(that is, same currency)
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each maturity category in a hedging set
(that is, same currency) = Effective Notional
Amount for maturity category × interest rate
supervisory factor
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Add-on for each hedging set = Σ(Add-ons for
maturity categories), aggregating across maturity
categories for a hedging set. One hedging set for
each currency.
4. Aggregate Simple summation of the add-ons for the different
hedging sets
Calculate Effective Notional Amount
The adjusted notional of each trade is calculated by multiplying the notional amount by the
calculated supervisory duration SD as defined in the Standards.
d = Trade Notional × SD = Trade Notional × (exp(-0.05×S) – exp(-0.05 × E)) / 0.05

Calculate Maturity Category Effective Notional
A supervisory delta is assigned to each trade in accordance with the Standards. In particular:
 Trade 1 is long in the primary risk factor (the reference floating rate) and is not an
option so the supervisory delta is equal to 1.
 Trade 2 is short in the primary risk factor and is not an option; thus, the supervisory
delta is equal to -1.
 Trade 3 is an option to enter into an interest rate swap that is short in the primary risk
factor and therefore is treated as a purchased put option. As such, the supervisory
delta is determined by applying the relevant formula using 50% as the supervisory
option volatility and 1 (year) as the option exercise date. Assume that the underlying
price (the appropriate forward swap rate) is 6% and the strike price (the swaption’s
fixed rate) is 5%.
The trade-level supervisory delta is therefore:
Trade Delta Instrument Type
Trade 1 1 linear, long (forward and swap)
Trade 2 -1 linear, short(forward and swap)
ln(0.06
)+0.5∗(0.5)2∗1
0.05
−Φ(− )=−0.27
Trade 3 0.5∗√1 purchased put option
The Maturity Factor MF is 1 for all the trades since they are un-margined and have remaining
maturities in excess of one year.
Based on the maturity categories, the Effective Notional D for the USE and EUR hedging sets at
the level of the maturity categories are as shown in the table below:

HS 2 (EUR) 3 37,427,961 -0.27 1 -10,105,550
In particular:
Hedging set USD, time bucket 3: D = 1 * 78,693,868 * 1 = 78,693,868
Hedging set USD, time bucket 2: D = -1 * 36,253,849 * 1 = -36,253,849

Apply Supervisory Factor
The add-on must be calculated for each hedging set.
For the USD hedging set there is partial offset between the two USD trades:
Effective notional(IR) [D22 + D32 + 1.4 x D2 x D3]1/2
USD =
= [(-36,253,849)2 + 78,693,8682 + 1.4 × (-36,253,849) × 78,693,868]1/2
= 59,269,963
For the Hedging set EUR there is only one trade (and one maturity category):
Effective notional(IR) = 10,105,550
EUR
In summary:

HS 2 (EUR)
Aggregation of the calculated add-ons across different hedging sets:
(No offset between hedging
Effective Notional(IR) = 59,269,963 + 10,105,550 = 69,375,513
sets)
The asset class is interest rates; thus the applicable Supervisory factor is 0.50%. As a result:
Add-on = SF × Effective Notional = 0.005 × 69,375,513 = 346,878
Supervisory Correlation Parameters
Correlation is not applicable to the interest rate asset class, and there is no other asset class in
the netting set in this example.
Add-on Aggregation
For this netting set, the interest rate add-on is also the aggregate add-on because there are no
trades assigned to other asset classes. Thus, the aggregate add-on = 346,878

Multiplier
The multiplier is given by:
multiplier = min { 1; Floor+(1-Floor) × exp [(V-C) /(2 ×(1-Floor)×Add-on agg)] }
= min {1; 0.05 + 0.95 × exp [60,000 / (2 × 0.95 × 346,878]}
=1
Final Calculation of PFE
In this case the multiplier is equal to one, so the PFE is the same as the aggregate Add-On:
PFE = multiplier × Add-on
agg
= 1 × 346,878 = 346,878
3. EAD Calculation
The exposure EAD to be risk weighted for counterparty credit risk capital requirements purposes
is therefore
EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE) = 1.4 x (60,000 + 346,878) = 569,629
B. Illustration 2
Consider a netting set with three credit derivatives: one long single-name CDS written on Firm A
(rated AA), one short single-name CDS written on Firm B (rated BBB), and one long CDS index
(investment grade). All notional amounts and market values are denominated in USD. This netting
set is not subject to a margin agreement and there is no exchange of collateral (independent
amount/initial margin) at inception. The table below summarizes the relevant contractual terms of
the three derivatives.

1. Replacement Cost Calculation
The replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level as a simple algebraic sum (floored at
zero) of the derivatives’ market values at the reference date. Thus, using the market values
indicated in the table (expressed in thousands):
RC = max {V - C; 0} = max {20 - 40 + 0; 0} = 0
Since V-C is negative (i.e. -20,000), the multiplier will be activated (i.e. it will be less than 1).
Before calculating its value, the aggregate add-on needs to be determined.
2. Potential Future Exposure Calculation
The following table illustrates the steps typically followed for the add-on calculation:
Steps Activities
1. Calculate Effective Notional Calculate supervisory duration
Calculate trade-level adjusted notional = trade
notional (in domestic currency) × supervisory
duration
Calculate trade-level effective notional amount =
trade-level adjusted notional × supervisory delta
× maturity factor
Calculate effective notional amount for each
entity by summing the trade-level effective
notional amounts for all trades referencing the
same entity (either a single entity or an index)
with full offsetting
2. Apply Supervisory Factors Add-on for each entity in a hedging set = Entity-
level Effective Notional Amount × Supervisory
Factor, which depends on entity’s credit rating (or
investment/speculative for index entities)
3. Apply Supervisory Correlations Entity-level add-ons are divided into systematic
and idiosyncratic components weighted by the
correlation factor
4. Aggregate Aggregationof entity-level add-ons with full
offsetting in the systematic component and no
offsetting in the idiosyncratic component
Effective Notional Amount
The adjusted notional of each trade is calculated by multiplying the notional amount with the
calculated supervisory duration SD specified in the Standards.
d= Trade Notional × SD = Trade Notional × {exp(-0.05×S) – exp(-0.05 × E)} / 0.05
