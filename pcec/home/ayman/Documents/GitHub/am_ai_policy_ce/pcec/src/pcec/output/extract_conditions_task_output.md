8. **Condition ID: 8**
   - **Description:** A bank must apply risk weights to its on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items using the risk-weighted assets approach. Risk weights are based on credit ratings or fixed risk weights and are broadly aligned with the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.
   - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 23]

9. **Condition ID: 9**
   - **Description:** A bank may use the ratings determined by an External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI) for credit ratings. In general, banks should only use solicited ratings from recognised ECAIs for the purposes of calculating capital requirement under the SA. However, in exceptional cases, the bank may use unsolicited ratings with the Central Bank approval.
   - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 23]

10. **Condition ID: 10**
    - **Description:** Note that all exposures subject to the SA should be risk weighted net of specific allowances and interest in suspense. The guidance must be read in conjunction with Securitisation, Equity Investments in Funds, Counterparty Credit Risk and Credit Valuation Guidance.

11. **Condition ID: 11**
    - **Description:** Banks have transition period of 7 years from the date of implementation for exposures to Federal Government that receive a 0% RW, if such exposures are denominated in AED or USD and funded in AED or USD. However, any claim on UAE Federal Government in foreign currency other than USD should be risk weighted according to the published credit risk rating of UAE Federal Government. In the absence of solicited rating for UAE Federal Government, unsolicited ratings are permissible for assigning risk weights for UAE Federal Government exposures.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 23]

12. **Condition ID: 12**
    - **Description:** Banks have transition period of 7 years from the date of implementation for exposures to Emirates Governments that receive a 0% RW, if such exposures are denominated in AED or USD and funded in AED or USD. Any claim on Emirates governments in a foreign currency other than USD should be risk weighted according to the rating of the Emirate Government.

13. **Condition ID: 13**
    - **Description:** If the regulators in GCC exercise their discretion to permit banks in their jurisdiction to allocate a lower risk weight to claims on that jurisdiction’s sovereign, denominated in the domestic currency of that jurisdiction and funded in that currency, the same, lower risk weight may be allocated to such claims (e.g. 0% assigned to the Government of Saudi Arabia if the exposure is denominated and funded in SAR). This is limited only to GCC sovereign exposures and this lower risk weight may be extended to the risk weighting of collateral and guarantees (refer to section on credit risk mitigation).
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 24]

14. **Condition ID: 14**
    - **Description:** All other exposures to sovereigns should be risk weighted according to the sovereign rating even if the national supervisory authority adopts preferential risk weights.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 24]

15. **Condition ID: 15**
    - **Description:** Non-Commercial PSEs include administrative bodies responsible to the UAE Federal Government, to the Emirates Governments, or to local authorities and other non-commercial undertakings owned by the Federal governments, Emirates Governments or local authorities. These non-commercial PSEs do not have specific revenue-raising powers or specific institutional arrangements the effect of which is to reduce their risks of default. The risk of non-commercial PSE exposures is not equivalent to the risk of sovereign exposures and hence the treatment of claims on sovereigns cannot be applied to non-commercial PSE. However, in exceptional cases, a Non-Commercial PSE may receive the same treatment as its sovereign, if the entity has proven formal arrangements in place to the effect that there is no distinction between the risk of the entity and the risk of its sovereign. The Central Bank's GRE List would reflect this accordingly.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 24]

16. **Condition ID: 16**
    - **Description:** If the UAE borrower satisfies the criteria in paragraph 13, the risk weight shall be the same as that for claims on banks. However, the preferential treatment for short-term claims on banks may not be applied. In particular, unrated non-commercial PSE qualify for 50% risk weight. The criteria are based on the principle that non-commercial PSEs qualify for lower risk weights because they have significantly lower risk than a commercial company does. In addition, banks are specifically required to ensure compliance with other aspects of the banking regulations when lending to these entities, for example, but not limited to, the Central Bank large exposure regulations.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 24]

17. **Condition ID: 17**
    - **Description:** The alternative criteria listed are to be applied in determining whether an entity qualifies for treatment as a non-commercial PSE. The Central Bank provides a list (so-called GRE List) to all the banks in the UAE which includes non-commercial PSEs.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 24]

18. **Condition ID: 18**
    - **Description:** In the case of a UAE sovereign guarantee given to a non-commercial PSE, with the Central Bank approval, the guarantee may be treated as eligible credit risk mitigation (CRM) to reduce the exposure provided the bank ensures compliance with the entire minimum regulatory requirements and operational requirements stated in the credit risk standard.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 25]

19. **Condition ID: 19**
    - **Description:** All banks must comply with the latest version of the GRE list for classification and risk weighting of entities. Banks that have information that would lead to the addition (or removal) of an entity to (or from) the GRE list must submit such information to the Central Bank. All banks must comply with the GRE list unless any addition or removal of entities is reflected in the GRE list.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 25]

24. **Condition ID: 24**
    - **Description:** The Central Bank sets out a minimum capital standard to cover the risk of equity positions held in the trading book. It applies to long and short positions in all instruments that exhibit behavior similar to equities, with the exception of non-convertible preference shares, which fall under interest rate risk requirements.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 103]

25. **Condition ID: 25**
    - **Description:** To calculate the minimum capital charge for equity risk, you must calculate two separate charges: A general market risk charge of 8% is applied to the net overall position. A specific risk charge of 8% is applied to the gross equity position. After offsetting long and short positions in the same issue, a bank's gross equity position is the sum of the absolute values of all long equity positions and all short equity positions.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 103]

26. **Condition ID: 26**
    - **Description:** Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the value of foreign exchange positions may be adversely affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange positions or exposures incur only general market risk. The capital charge for foreign exchange risk also include a charge for positions in gold. For purposes of market risk capital requirements, the Central Bank takes into account the stable relationship between the AED and the US dollar, with the result that no capital is charged for open positions in USD. Foreign currency is any currency other than the bank's reporting currency.
    - **Reference:** [Document: PI.pdf, Page 104]

27. **Condition ID: 27**
    - **Description:** The capital charge for foreign exchange market risk is 8% of the position resulting from the calculation above.

28. **Condition ID: 28**
    - **Description:** Banks with negligible business in foreign currencies and with no FX positions taken for their own account may exclude their FX positions if they meet both of the following requirements: their FX business (the greater of the sum of their gross long positions and the sum of their gross short positions) does not exceed 100% of total capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2). Their overall net open position does not exceed 2% of its total capital.

29. **Condition ID: 29**
    - **Description:** Commodity risk is the risk that on- or off-balance sheet positions will be adversely affected by movements in commodity prices. A commodity is defined as a physical product that can be traded on a secondary market, for example, agricultural products, minerals and precious metals. Gold; however, is covered under the framework for foreign exchange.
