Here is the structured list of policy compliance conditions and requirements extracted from chunk 8 (document.pdf, pages 61-75):

1. **Condition ID: RC-1**  
   - **Description**: Replacement Cost (RC) must be calculated as the maximum of (V - C), (TH + MTA - NICA), and 0, where V is the value of the derivative transactions, C is the value of collateral, TH is the threshold, MTA is the minimum transfer amount, and NICA is the net independent collateral amount.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 66.

2. **Condition ID: PFE-1**  
   - **Description**: Potential Future Exposure (PFE) must be calculated using the formula: PFE = multiplier × Add-on, where the multiplier is derived from a specified formula involving Floor, V, C, and Add-on.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 62.

3. **Condition ID: EAD-1**  
   - **Description**: Exposure at Default (EAD) must be calculated as 1.4 × (RC + PFE), where RC is the replacement cost and PFE is the potential future exposure.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 62.

4. **Condition ID: CVA-1**  
   - **Description**: Banks must calculate Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) capital using the standardised approach or a simple alternative approach, depending on the aggregate notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 67.

5. **Condition ID: CVA-2**  
   - **Description**: CVA capital must be calculated using the formula: CVA capital = 2.33 × √(variance of changes in CVA), reflecting a 99% confidence level.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 70.

6. **Condition ID: CVA-3**  
   - **Description**: Only specific instruments, such as index credit default swaps (CDS) or single-name CDS, are eligible as CVA hedges. Other instruments, such as tranched or nth-to-default CDS, are not eligible.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 69.

7. **Condition ID: CVA-4**  
   - **Description**: Banks must maintain documented CVA risk management processes to demonstrate the intent to manage CVA risk, and only transactions entered into explicitly for hedging CVA risk are eligible for recognition.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 69.

8. **Condition ID: CVA-5**  
   - **Description**: CVA risk mitigation must transfer risk to third parties external to the bank. Internal transactions within the bank are not eligible for CVA risk mitigation.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 69.

9. **Condition ID: CVA-6**  
   - **Description**: The CVA capital calculation must account for both systematic and idiosyncratic components of CVA risk, with systematic risk weighted at 0.5 and idiosyncratic risk weighted at 0.75.  
   - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 72.

10. **Condition ID: CVA-7**  
    - **Description**: The supervisory discount factor (DF) must be calculated as (1 - e^(-0.05M)) / 0.05, where M is the maturity period.  
    - **Reference**: document.pdf, Page 71.
