[Page 3]: This Guidance should be read in conjunction with the associated Standards issued by the Central Bank (Standards re Capital Adequacy of Banks in the UAE – December 2022).

[Page 5]: Tier Capital Supply Introduction This guidance explains how banks can comply with the Tier Capital Supply Standard.

[Page 5]: It must be read in conjunction with the Capital Regulation and Standards for Capital Adequacy of Banks in the UAE.

[Page 5]: To help and ensure a consistent and transparent implementation of Capital supply standards, Central Bank will review and update this guidance document periodically.

[Page 6]: For unrealized fair value reserves relating to financial instruments to be included in CET1 capital banks and their auditor must only recognize such gains or losses that are prudently valued and independently verifiable (e.g.

[Page 6]: The amount of cumulative unrealized losses arising from the changes in fair value of financial instruments, including loans/financing and receivables, classified as “available-for-sale” shall be fully deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital.

[Page 6]: Revaluation reserves or cumulative unrealized gains shall be added to CET 1 with a haircut of 55%.

[Page 6]: IFRS9 will be implemented during 2018.

[Page 6]: Such applications will be analysed and considered on a case-by-case basis.

[Page 6]: The amount reported under accumulated retained earnings (5.1.4.1) should be as per the audited financial statement at year end and should remain the same for the entire financial year.

[Page 6]: Dividend expected/ proposed for the financial year should be reported under 5.1.4.3 and will be deducted from Retained Earnings/ (Loss) (5.1.4).

[Page 6]: The dividend deduction must be updated based on each of the following events, if the amount changes, after Annual General meeting, or the approval from the Central Ban, or the release of the Financial Statements by the auditors.

[Page 6]: Prudential filter: Partial addback of ECL in accordance with the Regulation Regarding Accounting Provisions and Capital Requirements - Transitional Arrangements should be reported under 5.1.4.4 IFRS transitional arrangement.

[Page 7]: Amount exceeding Large Exposure threshold: Any amount that is in violation of Large Exposure regulation of notice 300/2013 shall be deducted from the capital.

[Page 7]: However, amounts that are not deducted must be included in risk weighted assets.

[Page 7]: Furthermore, any counterparty credit risk (under CR2a) associated with such exposure must remain included in the calculation of risk weighted asset.

[Page 7]: The deduction should be reported under 5.1.4.5 of the BRF 95.

[Page 7]: The buffer for internationally active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers deployed across all the jurisdictions to which it has credit exposures.

[Page 7]: The buffer that will apply to each bank will reflect the geographic composition of its portfolio of credit exposures.

[Page 7]: When considering the jurisdiction to which a private sector credit exposure relates, banks should use, where possible, an ultimate risk basis; i.e.

[Page 7]: it should use the country where the guarantor of the exposure resides, not where the exposure has been booked.

[Page 7]: Banks will have to look at the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures (including non-bank financial sector exposures) and calculate their countercyclical capital buffer requirement as a weighted average of the buffers that are being applied in jurisdictions to which they have an exposure.

[Page 7]: The weighting applied to the buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be the bank’s total credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction, divided by the bank’s total credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions.

[Page 7]: Banks must determine whether the ultimate counterparty is a private sector exposure, as well as the location of the “ultimate risk”, to the extent possible.

[Page 7]: The charge for the relevant portfolio should be allocated to the geographic regions of the constituents of the portfolio by calculating the proportion of the portfolio’s total credit exposure arising from credit exposure to counterparties in each geographic region.

[Page 8]: The amount of intangible assets to be deducted should be net of any associated deferred tax liability (DTL) that would be extinguished if the asset became impaired or derecognised under the applicable accounting standards.

[Page 8]: The amount that is recognised will receive risk weight of 250% and the remaining amount will be deducted.

[Page 9]: Furthermore, the expected dividend should be deducted in Q4.

[Page 9]: Reference should also be made to the Tier Capital Instruments Standards.

[Page 10]: Should it be considered since the standards mentions insurance subsidiaries are to be completely deconsolidated and hence there will be no goodwill?

[Page 10]: Goodwill and other intangible must be deducted in the calculation of CET1.

[Page 10]: Question 10: Subsidiaries which are used for providing manpower services at cost, should these be classified as commercial entities or financial entities?

[Page 10]: The underlying process for the implementation of countercyclical buffers will be set and communicated during 2018.

[Page 10]: Can the Central Bank give additional guidance on what will be considered to be an incentive to redeem?

[Page 10]: Conversion from a fixed rate to a floating rate (or vice versa) in combination with a call option without any increase in credit spread will not in itself be viewed as an incentive to redeem.

[Page 10]: However, as required by criteria 5, the bank must not do anything that creates an expectation that the call will be exercised.

[Page 10]: The above is not an exhaustive list of what is considered an incentive to redeem and so banks should seek guidance from Central Bank on specific features and instruments.

[Page 10]: Banks must not expect Central Bank to approve the exercise of a call option for the purpose of satisfying investor expectations that a call will be exercised.

[Page 11]: However, the specification of multiple dates upon which a call might be exercised must not be used to create an expectation that the instrument will be redeemed at the first call date, as this is prohibited by criterion.

[Page 11]: How should the geographic location of exposures on the banking book and the trading book be identified?

[Page 11]: For the purpose of the countercyclical capital buffer, banks should use, where possible, exposures on an “ultimate risk” basis.

[Page 11]: This means that if the bank has a debt claim on an investment vehicle, the ultimate risk exposure should be allocated to the jurisdiction where the vehicle (or if applicable, its parent/guarantor) resides.

[Page 11]: If the bank has an equity claim, the ultimate risk exposure should be allocated proportionately to the jurisdictions where the ultimate risk exposures of the vehicle resides.

[Page 12]: Amount not deducted to considered for aggregate threshold deduction 100 The remaining amount of 100 is to be distributed amongst the investments on a pro rata / proportionate basis and risk weighted at 250% (assuming no threshold deduction apply).The total of 250 RWA (100 *250%) will be distributed as follows.

[Page 19]: (9.5% available CET1 - 8.5% CET1 required to fulfill the Tier 1 minimum requirement of 8.5%).

[Page 20]: This guidance explains how banks should comply with the Tier Capital Instruments Standard.

[Page 20]: It must be read in conjunction with the Capital Regulation and Standards for Capital Adequacy of Banks in the UAE.

[Page 20]: The Central Bank expects that issuers will formulate the terms and conditions so that they are not complex, but as simple and as clear as possible.

[Page 20]: Prudential clauses of importance from a prudential point of view should not be written in italics.

[Page 20]: They should also not be worded in a way that makes it unclear whether they do actually apply (e.g.

[Page 20]: Terms and conditions must be worded clearly.

[Page 20]: The wording used must be in accordance with that in the Capital Standards/ Guidance.

[Page 20]: The text should avoid making references to ‘as determined by the bank’ or to regulatory reporting dates.

[Page 20]: All requirements must be fulfilled at any time.

[Page 20]: Additional Tier 1 instruments will rank below Tier 2 instruments by virtue of subordination.

[Page 20]: The instrument should not be subject to set-off or netting arrangements that would undermine the instrument's capacity to absorb losses.

### **Pages 21-40:**
[Page 21]: Changes must be legally enforceable.

[Page 21]: Significant Changes to Terms and Conditions: Significant changes to the terms and conditions of the instrument will require the approval of the holders.

[Page 21]: No provision should link a change in payments to contractual, statutory or other obligations, as payments are fully discretionary.

[Page 21]: Payments should also not be linked to payments on other Additional Tier 1 instruments.

[Page 21]: However, stoppers must not impede the full discretion that bank must have at all times to cancel distributions/payments on the instrument, nor must they act in a way that could hinder the recapitalization of the bank.

[Page 22]: The dividend stopper will remain until one coupon following the dividend stopper date has been made in full or an amount equal to the same has been duly set aside or provided for in full for the benefit of the holders of the instrument.

[Page 22]: Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA): To further clarify the MDA’s calculation, below is an example of the calculation: Bank Capital Holdings 14.0% Bank Capital Requirements % CET1 7.0% AT1 1.5% Tier 2 2.0% Pillar 2 0.0% Capital Conservation Buffer 2.5% Countercyclical Buffer 0.000% D-SIB Buffer 1.5% Total 14.5% Combined Buffer 4.0% Quartile of Buffer 1.0% Bank Capital Gap 0.5% Quartile 1 Quartile 2 Quartile 3 Quartile 4 0.0 1.0% 1.0% 2.0% 2.0% 3.0% 3.0% 4.0% The bank first will need to fulfill all minimum requirements.

[Page 23]: Where a bank does not have positive earnings and has a CET1 ratio less than 9.5%, it would be restricted from making positive net distributions.

[Page 23]: The issuance of any new shares as a result of the Point of Non-Viability must occur prior to any public sector injection of capital so that the capital provided by the public sector is not diluted.

[Page 23]: If a Tier 2 instrument eligible for grandfathering begins its final five-year amortisation period prior to 1st January 2018, the base for grandfathering in this case must take into account the amortised amount, not the full nominal amount.

[Page 23]: As for the rate, if a Tier 2 instrument eligible for grandfathering begins its final amortisation period on 1st January 2018, then individual instruments will continue to be amortised at a rate of 20% per year while the grandfathering cap will be reduced at a rate of 10% per year.

[Page 24]: CBUAE Classification: Public Documents required to be submitted for the application to issue new Tier Capital Instruments 1.

[Page 24]: The CN-01 form should be completed, filled and signed by the bank's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Head of Internal Audit, Head of Compliance and Head of Risk.

[Page 24]: Instruments of Islamic banks issued through an SPV must also provide the contract between the bank and the SPV 3.

[Page 24]: The approval shall relate to an issuance of the specific planned Tier capital instrument (Additional Tier 1 or subordinated Tier 2).

[Page 24]: Moreover, the approval should clearly mention that the instrument is subordinated; coupon payments may not be paid under certain circumstances, and contains a Point of Non-Viability (PONV) condition.

[Page 24]: Legal opinion of an independent appropriately qualified and experienced lawyer that the obligations contained in terms and conditions will constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations.

[Page 24]: Capital planning and forecast: The Business as Usual (BAU) case should be formulated, such as: a) Amount of assumed issuance and the expected issuance date (e.g.

[Page 24]: on balance growth, asset structure, conversation factors CCF for off balance, operational and market risk, total assets growth, of which businesses that will be the main driver for such growth) and CRWA (i.e.

[Page 24]: Stress Testing Scenarios: The Stress Testing should be submitted in form of a presentation including the underlying data in Excel sheet.

[Page 24]: Two Scenarios should be provided as part of the presentation: a) Top 2 customers defaulting (point in time analysis permitted: End of Year): Definition of top 2 customers; name of top 2 customers; exposure (including on and off balance exposures); what type of eligible collateral and value of collateral, with two sub-scenarios: i.

[Page 25]:  Market Conformity Analysis: The bank has to provide evidence on why the pricing of the instrument conforms to the market rate.

[Page 25]: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Question 1: The last bullet point mentions “Liability accounted instruments must set the loss absorption trigger at a level of 7.625%.” Is it Central Bank decision to have this trigger set at 7.625%?

[Page 25]: Question 2: Point of Non-Viability mentions that “A Point of Non-Viability means that the Regulator has determined that the issuer has or will become, Non-Viable without: (a) a Write-down; or (b) a public injection of capital (or equivalent support).”.

[Page 25]: We need clarification as to whether the PONV will be determined by the regulator or the issuer.

[Page 25]: Also, please advise under what circumstance will partial Write-down be permitted.

[Page 25]: Partial write-down will be permitted only for exceptional cases.

[Page 25]: Explicit examples will not be provided to prevent any expectation.

[Page 26]: This guidance should be read in conjunction with the Central Bank’s Standard on Credit Risk.

[Page 26]: A bank must apply risk weights to its on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items using the risk- weighted assets approach.

[Page 26]: In general, banks should only use solicited ratings from recognised ECAIs for the purposes of calculating capital requirement under the SA.

[Page 26]: Note that all exposures subject to the SA should be risk weighted net of specific allowances and interest in suspense.

[Page 26]: The guidance must be read in conjunction with Securitisation, Equity Investments in Funds, Counterparty Credit Risk and Credit Valuation Guidance.

[Page 26]: Exposures in the trading book should be captured as part of a bank’s market risk capital calculations.

[Page 26]: However, any claim on UAE Federal Government in foreign currency other than USD should be risk weighted according to the published credit risk rating of UAE Federal Government.

[Page 26]: Any claim on Emirates governments in a foreign currency other than USD should be risk weighted according to the rating of the Emirate Government.

[Page 27]: All other exposures to sovereigns should be risk weighted according to the sovereign rating even if the national supervisory authority adopts preferential risk weights.

[Page 27]: The risk of non-commercial PSE exposures is not equivalent to the risk of sovereign exposures and hence the treatment of claims on sovereigns cannot be applied to non-commercial PSE.

[Page 27]: If the UAE borrower satisfies the criteria in paragraph 13, the risk weight shall be the same as that for claims on banks.

[Page 27]: However, the preferential treatment for short-term claims on banks may not be applied.

[Page 27]: In addition, banks are specifically required to ensure compliance with other aspects of the banking regulations when lending to these entities, for example, but not limited to, the Central Bank large exposure regulations.

[Page 27]: The service provided should be of substantial public benefit and the entity should have a monopolistic nature and there should be a significant likelihood that the government would not let the entity go bankrupt.

[Page 28]: All banks must comply with the latest version of the GRE list for classification and risk weighting of entities.

[Page 28]: Banks that have information that would lead to the addition (or removal) of an entity to (or from) the GRE list must submit such information to the Central Bank.

[Page 28]: All banks must comply with the GRE list unless any addition or removal of entities is reflected in the GRE list.

[Page 28]: Banks Internal audit/compliance department should perform regular reviews to ensure the PSE and GRE classification complies with the Central Bank GRE list.

[Page 28]: Claims on multilateral development banks (MDBs) Exposures to MDBs shall in general be treated similar to claim on banks, but without using the preferential treatment for short term claims.

[Page 28]: a majority of an MDB's external assessments must be AAA; ii.

[Page 29]: All banks are required to refer to and comply with the BCBS list.

[Page 29]: exposures to the head office shall receive the risk weight according to the rating of the head office).

[Page 29]: Claims on Securities Firms In addition to providing loans to other banks in the interbank market, banks provide loans to securities firms.

[Page 29]: Exposures to these securities firms shall be treated as claims on banks if these firms are subject to prudential standards and a level of supervision that is equivalent to those applicable to banks.

[Page 29]: Such supervision must include at least both capital and liquidity requirements.

[Page 29]: Exposures to all other securities firms that are not treated as claims on banks will be treated as exposures to corporates.

[Page 30]: All other retail claims should be risk weighted at 100%.

[Page 30]: In case of off-balance sheet items, the gross amount will be calculated after applying credit conversion factors.

[Page 30]: The property must be fully mortgaged in favor of the bank.

[Page 30]: The value of the property will be maintained at the value at origination unless the Central Bank requires banks to revise the property value downward.

[Page 30]: The value must be adjusted if an extraordinary, idiosyncratic event occurs resulting in a permanent reduction of the property value.

[Page 30]: Such adjustment must be notified to the Central Bank.

[Page 30]: A 35% risk weighting shall apply to eligible residential claims if the LTV ratio is less than 85% and the exposure is less than AED 10 million.

[Page 30]: When the loan amount exceeds AED 10 million and the LTV is below 85%, the loan amount up to AED 10 million will receive 35% risk weight and the remaining amount above AED 10 million receives 100% risk weight.

[Page 30]: A risk weight of 75% may be applied by banks that do not hold information regarding LTVs for individual exposures For residential exposures that meet the criteria for regulatory retail claims and have an LTV greater than 85%, the 75% risk weight must be applied to the whole loan, i.e.

[Page 30]: the loan should not be split.

[Page 30]: Any additional exposure to a customer with loans for four individual properties shall be classified as a claim on a commercial property and risk weighted with 100%.

[Page 31]: Any exposure that is past due for more than 90 days should be reported under this asset class, net of specific provisions (including partial write-offs).

[Page 31]: The standard risk weight for all other assets will be 100%, with the exception of the following exposures: a) 0% risk weight applied to: i.

[Page 32]: Investments in commercial entities in excess of the materiality thresholds must be risk- weighted at 1/ (Minimum capital requirement) (i.e.

[Page 32]: Banks should use original maturity to report these instruments.

[Page 32]: Commitments with an original maturity up to one year and commitments with an original maturity over one year will receive a CCF of 20% and 50%, respectively.

[Page 32]: However, any commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank without prior notice, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to deterioration in a borrower’s creditworthiness, will receive a 0% CCF.

[Page 33]: For example, a commitment to provide collateral or a guarantee is not recognised as an eligible CRM technique for capital adequacy purposes until the commitment to do so is actually fulfilled.

[Page 33]: No additional CRM will be recognised for capital adequacy purposes on exposures where the risk weight is mapped from a rating specific to a debt security where that rating already reflects CRM.

[Page 33]: For example, if the rating has already taken into account a guarantee pledged by the parent or sovereign entity, then the guarantee shall not be considered again for credit risk mitigation purposes.

[Page 33]: Banks should ensure that all minimum legal and the operational requirements set out in the Standard are fulfilled.

[Page 33]: However, where the credit protection is denominated in a currency different from that of the underlying obligation, the covered portion should be reduced by a standard supervisory haircut defined in the Credit Risk Standard for the currency mismatch.

[Page 33]: Where the collateral includes cash deposits, certificates of deposit, cash funded credit-linked notes, or other comparable instruments, which are held at a third-party bank in a non-custodial arrangement and unconditionally and irrevocably pledged or assigned to the bank, the collateral will be allocated the same risk weight as that of the third party bank.

[Page 33]: Simple Approach Under simple approach, the eligible collateral must be pledged for at least the life of the exposure, i.e.

[Page 34]: If the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies, the bank must adjust downwards the volatility- adjusted collateral amount to take into account possible future fluctuations in exchange rates.

[Page 34]: Banks should take all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the CRM and to address related risks.

[Page 34]: Shari’ah Implementation Banks that conduct all or part of their activities in accordance with the provisions of Shari’ah laws and have exposure to risks similar to those mentioned in the Credit Risk Standard, shall, for the purpose of maintaining an appropriate level of capital, calculate the relevant risk weighted asset in line with these guidelines.

[Page 34]: This must be done in a manner compliant with the Shari’ah laws.

[Page 34]: During the 7-year transition period, banks are required to have a forward looking plan on USD exposures to Federal and Emirate governments.

[Page 34]: Banks shall monitor and manage the impact of the change in risk weights of exposures in USD on the bank’s capital position.

[Page 34]: Exposures in USD as well as the banks’ capital plans will be monitored by the Central Bank.

[Page 34]: However, exposures in non-domestic currencies (including USD) shall be risk weighted according to the rating of sovereigns.

[Page 35]: Bank should use ratings determined by an eligible External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAIs).

[Page 35]: All other exposures shall be risk weighted using solicited ratings.

[Page 35]: In addition, does the bank just follow the so-called GRE list or shall the bank apply the criteria to classify entities as non-commercial PSE?

[Page 35]: To classify entities as Non-commercial PSE, the Central Bank will consider in its approval process all seven criteria and in principle all seven criteria must be satisfied.

[Page 35]: If banks have information that would lead to changes to of the GRE List, banks should inform the Central Bank accordingly.

[Page 35]: The frequency of internal audit/compliance should be commensurate with the bank's size, the nature and risks of bank’s operations and the complexity of the bank.

[Page 35]: Claims on Corporates Question 9: Should loans to High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) be reported under claims in regulatory retail portfolio or claims on corporate?

[Page 36]: CBUAE Classification: Public No, HNI classification should be aligned with the BRF explanatory note and should be reported under claims on corporate.

[Page 36]: Yes, if a customer has more than 4 properties, a bank has to report all properties of that customer as claims on commercial properties and the risk weight of the properties shall be 100%.

[Page 36]: The Central Bank will apply a 150% or higher risk weight, reflecting the higher risks associated with assets that require separate disclosure.

[Page 36]: For example, but not limited to, real estate acquired in settlement of debt and not liquidated within the statutory period shall be reported under the higher risk asset class with a 150% RW.

[Page 36]: Other Assets Question 15: The Credit Risk Standard states in section 5, that equity investment in commercial entities that are below the thresholds shall be risk weighted at 150% if the entity is unlisted.

[Page 37]: CBUAE Classification: Public Issuer and Issuance Rating Question 16: What will be the treatment of a rated entity (e.g.

[Page 37]: The bank must classify the bond based on the entity classification (Claim on Corporate) and assign risk weight based on the rating of the entity.

[Page 37]: Question 17: What will be the treatment of a rated entity (e.g.

[Page 37]: Question 18: What will be the treatment of a rated entity (e.g.

[Page 37]: Question 19: What will be the treatment if an unrated entity (e.g.

[Page 37]: The guarantee should be used for credit risk mitigation by substituting the risk weight of the bond using the claims on sovereign mapping table (e.g.

[Page 37]: Question 20: What will be the treatment if an unrated entity (e.g.

[Page 37]: The guarantee should be used for credit risk mitigation by substituting the risk weight of the bond using the claims on corporate mapping table (e.g.

[Page 37]: Off Balance-sheet Items Question 22: The Credit Risk Standards states that, “Any commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank without prior notice, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to deterioration in a borrower’s creditworthiness must be converted into credit exposure equivalents using CCF of 0%”.

[Page 37]: For using CCF of 0%, please provide explanation on being cancellable at any time without prior notice.

[Page 37]: Majority of the unconditionally cancellable commitments are subject to certain contractual conditions, which in practice may not render them as unconditionally cancelled and thereby do not qualify them for 0% CCF, implying that all the off-balance sheet items bear a risk to the bank.

[Page 37]: Bank shall conduct a formal review of the commitments at regular intervals to ensure that commitments can be cancelled from a legal and practical perspective.

[Page 38]: CBUAE Classification: Public applies the comprehensive approach, is an approval required to go back to the simple approach?

[Page 38]: Minimum holding period for various products Transaction type Minimum holding period Condition Repo-style transaction 5 Business days Daily remargining Other capital market transactions 10 Business days Daily remargining Secured lending 20 Business days Daily revaluation The haircut for the transaction with other than 10 business days minimum holding period, as indicated above, will have to be adjusted by scaling up or down the haircut for 10 business days as per the formula given below: NR+(TM−1) H=HM√ 𝑇M Variables Details of the Variables Supervisory haircuts Scaling Adjusted haircuts factor He Haircut appropriate to the Exposure in the form of cash, 0 Not applicable underlying exposure supervisory haircut 0% Hc Haircut appropriate to the Debt securities issued by a 0.71 Supervisory haircut Collateral bank (8%)* Scaling factor supervisory haircut 8% (0.71 )= 6% Hfx Haircut appropriate for No Currency Mismatch 0 Not applicable Currency Mismatch The exposure amount after risk mitigation is calculated as follows: Variables E*= max {0, [E x (1 + He) – C x (1 – Hc – Hfx)]} Value E* Net credit exposure (i.e.

[Page 40]: When determining the RC component of a netting set, the netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.

[Page 40]: The Standards requires that a bank should apply netting only when it can satisfy the Central Bank that netting is appropriate, according to the specific requirements established in the Standards.

[Page 40]: Banks should recognize that this requirement would likely be difficult to meet in the case of trades conducted in jurisdictions lacking clear legal recognition of netting, which at present is the case in the UAE.

[Page 40]: If netting is not recognized, then netting sets still should be used for the calculation.

[Page 40]: However, since each netting set must contain only trades that can be netted, each netting set is likely to consist of a single transaction.

[Page 40]: In that case, the CCR calculations should be performed for each netting set individually.

### **Pages 41-60:**
[Page 42]: The view of the Central Bank is that a single, standardised definition of one year for this purpose will enhance comparability across banks and over time.

[Page 42]: With respect to direction, a derivative may be long exposure to the underlying risk factor (price, rate, volatility, etc.), in which case the value of the derivative will move in the same direction as the underlying – gaining value with increases, losing value with decreases – and the delta is positive to reflect this relationship.

[Page 42]: For example, with an option on a foreign currency, when the exchange rate changes by a given amount, the change in the value of the derivative – the option contract – will almost always be less than the change in the exchange rate.

[Page 42]: Moreover, the amount by which the change is less than one-for-one will vary depending on a number of factors, including the current exchange rate relative to the exercise price of the option, the time remaining to expiration of the option, and the current volatility of the exchange rate.

[Page 42]: In general, banks should use a forward price or rate, ideally reflecting any interim cash flows on the underlying instrument, as P in the supervisory delta calculation.

[Page 43]: The precise specification (including the values of the embedded constants of 14 and 15) is the result of an empirical exercise conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to identify a relatively simple functional form that would provide a sufficiently close fit to CDO sensitivities as reported by a set of globally active banks.

[Page 43]: A supervisory volatility of 50% should be used on swaptions for all currencies.

[Page 44]: multi- asset or hybrid derivatives) must be allocated to more than one asset class when the material risk drivers span more than one asset class.

[Page 44]: The full amount of the trade must be included in the PFE calculation for each of the relevant asset classes.

[Page 44]: Hedging sets for derivatives that reference the volatility of a risk factor (volatility transactions) must follow the same hedging set construction outlined in the Standards for derivatives in that asset class; for example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging set.

[Page 44]: The Basel framework does not provide a specific treatment of unrated reference assets.

[Page 44]: For an entity for which a credit rating is not available, a bank should use the Supervisory Factor corresponding to BBB.

[Page 44]: However, where the exposure is associated with an elevated risk of default, the bank should use the Supervisory Factor for BB.

[Page 44]: In this context, “elevated risk of default” should also be understood to include instances in which it is difficult or impossible to assess adequately whether the exposure has high risk of loss due to default by the obligor.

[Page 44]: A bank trading credit derivatives referencing unrated entities should conduct their own analysis to examine this risk.

[Page 44]: The prices of commodities of a given type may not move precisely in lock step, but they are likely to move in the same direction at roughly the same time, due to their dependence on common forces in commodity markets.

[Page 45]: Nonetheless, banks should attempt to minimize unrecognized basis risk through sound definitions of commodity types.

[Page 45]: The Standards requires a bank to establish appropriate governance processes for the creation and maintenance of the list of defined commodity types used by the bank for CCR calculations, with clear definitions and independent internal review or validation processes to ensure that commodities grouped as a single type are in fact similar.

[Page 45]: Single- name transactions should be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the underlying reference debt instrument of those transactions is issued by the same issuer.

[Page 45]: The approach for establishing the reference entity for equity derivatives should correspond to the general approach for credit derivatives.

[Page 45]: For credit derivatives with indices as the underlying instrument, there should be one reference entity for each group of reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives that underlie a multi-name transaction.

[Page 45]: Multi-name transactions should be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the group of underlying reference debt instruments or single- name credit derivatives of those transactions has the same constituents.

[Page 45]: The determination of whether an index is investment grade or speculative grade should be based on the credit quality of the majority of its individual constituents.

[Page 45]: Again, the approach for equity index derivatives should follow the general approach for credit index derivatives.

[Page 45]: When multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, the netting set should be broken down into sub-netting sets that align with the respective margin agreement for calculating both RC and PFE.

[Page 46]: Net collateral available to the bank should include both VM and NICA.

[Page 46]: One of the following cases then applies: Step 5a: If NVH>0 (so NVP=0), then RC = TPV – NVH, but with a minimum of zero – that is, RC cannot be negative.

[Page 46]: or Step 5b: If NVH=0 (so NVP>0), then RC = TPV + NVP – TNV, but with a minimum of TPV – that is, RC cannot be less than TPV.

[Page 46]: To calculate PFE when a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, netting set level un-margined PFEs should be calculated and aggregated, i.e.

[Page 46]: PFE should be calculated as the sum of all the individual netting sets considered as if they were not subject to any form of margin agreement.

[Page 49]: Netting Question A1: Does a bank need written approval for each netting agreement it has in place, or will the Central Bank provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties?

[Page 49]: The bank should establish an internal process that considers the factors identified in the Standards.

[Page 49]: That process should be subject to internal review and challenge per the Standards.

[Page 49]: The Central Bank will review the identification of netting sets as part of the supervisory process, and notify the bank of any determinations that netting is not appropriate.

[Page 49]: The Central Bank will not provide a list of pre-approved jurisdictions or counterparties.

[Page 49]: Will they be included or excluded from the exposure calculation?

[Page 49]: Trades with negative value have RC=0, but still have counterparty credit risk, which will be reflected in the calculation of the PFE component of exposure.

[Page 49]: Collateral Question B1: What haircuts should be applied to collateral for the calculations of exposure net of collateral?

[Page 49]: Banks should apply the standard supervisory haircuts from the capital framework.

[Page 50]: Yes, derivatives with exposure to more than one primary risk factor should be allocated to all relevant asset classes for the PFE calculation, so this transaction should be included in its full amount in both the Foreign Exchange hedging set and the Interest Rate hedging set.

[Page 50]: Question C2: In a cross-currency swap with principal exchange at the beginning and at the end, and with fixed-rate to fixed-rate interest exchange so that there is no interest rate risk, should this trade be included only in the foreign currency category?

[Page 50]: Yes, it should be treated as FX exposure.

[Page 50]: Question D2: The Standards states that the Supervisory Delta for a short position (one that is not an option or CDO) should be -1.

[Page 50]: However, if netting is
