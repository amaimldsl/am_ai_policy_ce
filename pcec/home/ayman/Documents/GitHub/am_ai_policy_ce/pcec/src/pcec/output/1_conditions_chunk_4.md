Here is the list of policy compliance conditions, requirements, and obligations extracted from chunk 4:

1. **Condition ID: CVA-1**  
   **Description:** Banks are required to use a weighted average maturity calculation for netting sets, with notional values as the weights.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 76]  

2. **Condition ID: CVA-2**  
   **Description:** Banks must apply risk weights to derivatives exposures and CVA hedges based on the credit rating of counterparties or underlying entities. Unrated counterparties must be treated as BBB rated unless they have an elevated risk of default, in which case they should be treated as BB rated.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 77]  

3. **Condition ID: CVA-3**  
   **Description:** Banks must multiply the calculated CVA capital by a factor of 12.5 to determine the corresponding Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA).  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 77]  

4. **Condition ID: CVA-4**  
   **Description:** Banks with an aggregate notional amount of covered transactions less than or equal to 400 billion AED may choose to set CVA RWA equal to the bank’s RWA for counterparty credit risk. However, this approach must be applied to all covered transactions, and the bank may not recognize the risk-reducing effects of CVA hedges.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 77]  

5. **Condition ID: CVA-5**  
   **Description:** The Central Bank may prohibit a bank from using the simple alternative approach if it determines that CVA risk from the bank’s derivative positions and SFTs materially contributes to the bank’s overall risk.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 77]  

6. **Condition ID: CVA-6**  
   **Description:** Debit valuation adjustment (DVA) cannot be taken into account to reduce regulatory CVA for the capital calculation.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 78]  

7. **Condition ID: CVA-7**  
   **Description:** CVA hedges must refer specifically to the counterparty by name, and their value must increase when the credit quality of the counterparty being hedged deteriorates. "Nth-to-default" credit derivatives are not permitted as CVA hedges.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 78]  

8. **Condition ID: CVA-8**  
   **Description:** Banks must calculate weighted average maturity for each netting set, reflecting all covered transactions within the netting set, regardless of asset class.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 78]  

9. **Condition ID: CVA-9**  
   **Description:** If a counterparty has ratings from multiple rating agencies, the higher risk weight must be applied. If there are ratings from three or more agencies, the two lowest risk weights should be referred to, and the higher of the two must be applied.  
   **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

10. **Condition ID: CVA-10**  
    **Description:** All SFT exposures must be reflected in the CVA calculation, whether or not they create non-zero gross SFT asset values for the leverage ratio.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

11. **Condition ID: CVA-11**  
    **Description:** Haircuts should not be applied to the fair value of securities when determining exposure for SFTs.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

12. **Condition ID: CVA-12**  
    **Description:** Banks must apply the same multiplicative scaling factor of 1.4 for the CVA calculation as used in the SA-CCR standards.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

13. **Condition ID: CVA-13**  
    **Description:** Banks must use the rating for the entity that is actually obligated as a counterparty under the terms of the transactions within the applicable netting set.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

14. **Condition ID: CVA-14**  
    **Description:** Banks must apply the CVA risk weight that corresponds to the rating of the entity, or if unrated, apply the approach specified for unrated counterparties.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]  

15. **Condition ID: CVA-15**  
    **Description:** Banks must consistently apply a conservative treatment to unrated counterparties and should not reduce exposure for the CVA calculation relative to the treatment stated in the standards.  
    **Reference:** [Document: document.pdf, Page 79]
