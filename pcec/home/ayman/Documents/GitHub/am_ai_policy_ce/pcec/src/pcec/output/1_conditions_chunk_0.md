3. **Condition ID: 122**
   - **Description**: Each bank is expected to conduct reverse stress tests. Reverse stress tests start with the identification of a pre-defined outcome where the bank’s business model becomes non-viable or it breaches supervisory compliance minima. The next step is to assess which scenarios and shocks lead to that identified outcome. Finally, the objective is to assess whether the likelihood of occurrence is realistic and the impact warrants mitigating actions.
